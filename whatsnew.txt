+Fix CF_GetTrackFXChain with named tracks (Issue 1222) and disambiguate FX chains across all opened projects
+Harden ConfigVar functions against invalid type interpretation (Issue 1131)

Region Playlist:
+Fix pasting region playlists containing grouped items (Issue 1118)
+Fix pasting region playlists when "Overlap and crossfade items when splitting" is enabled in Preferences > Project > Media Item Defaults (Issue 1204)

Resources:
+Enter key in Filter textbox focuses list and don't block Del key (Issue 1119)

Snapshots:
+Add option to (not) prompt for deleting abandoned items when recalling snapshots which contain deleted tracks (snapshots will be recalled and abandoned items deleted without confirmation with this option disabled) (Issue 1073)
+Harden getting send envelopes (displays error message in case of failure)
+Include track phase (polarity) in Full Track Mix, add separate Phase tickbox as custom filter (Issue 455)

Note: Send envelopes should now be stored/recalled correctly with Snapshots (long standing bug) as of SWS v2.10.0, though it hasn't been tested much. Since snapshots are based on state chunks, changes within automation items (AI) envelopes are not stored/recalled currently (https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=205406|FR|), though AI properties (e.g. position) should be recalled correctly. Also note that when deleting an AI and trying to recall a previously stored snapshot which contains this AI it won't be recalled correctly.

Windows installer:
+Allow installing SWS to paths containing characters outside of the system's ANSI codepage
+Fix nonworking check for running REAPER processes
+Fix the install path being initially empty when launching the Windows installer if REAPER is not installed
+Make installing the Python ReaScript support optional
+Migrate the extension DLL to <resource path>\UserPlugins, reaper_sws.py to <resource path>\Scripts

"Xenakios/SWS: Rename takes and source files...": (Issue 1140)
+Add '(no undo)' to the action name
+Automatically delete old .reapeaks files (also for "Xenakios/SWS: Rename take source files...")
+Don't double-append file extension if already contained in new filename/takename

!v2.10.0 #1 Featured build (February 6, 2019)
Mega thanks to nofish and cfillion for their many contributions, and X-Raym for doing the tedious work of merging everything into a release.
Recommended use of REAPER 5.965.

Revert 'Track height actions and vertical zoom actions obey track height locking' (for not breaking existing workflows, may come back as optional later on)
"SWS/NF: Enable / Disable multichannel metering (...)" actions: Improve performance (report https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?p=2090523#post2090523|here|, thanks Edgemeal!)

!v2.10.0 pre-release build (February 2, 2019)
New features:
+Auto color/icon/layout: Add '(hide)' Layout to auto hide TCP / MCP of tracks (rightclick in "TCP Layout" / "MCP Layout" fields to set) (Issue 1008)
+Global notes
+Loudness: Add 'high precision' analyzing mode
 Set in 'SWS/BR: Analyze loudness...' window -> Options or via action, see below), to ensure full compliance with BS.1770-4. Off by default.
 Notes: This mode is slower than the 'normal' analyzing mode and should only be needed when ensuring exact results of max. momentary values in certain (corner) cases is required.
 All other results should be compliant with BS.1770-4 also in 'normal' analyzing mode.
 Technically this mode uses 100 Hz refresh rate / 10 ms buffer rather than default 5 Hz refresh rate / 200 ms buffer for analyzing.
 For background see https://github.com/reaper-oss/sws/issues/1046#issuecomment-428914818|here| and https://github.com/jiixyj/libebur128/issues/93#issuecomment-429043548|here|.
 ReScript Loudness functions respect this preference.
 - Add action 'SWS/BR/NF: Toggle use high precision mode for loudness analyzing'

Actions:
+New actions (Main section):
 - Snapshots: Add actions to delete current/all snapshots (request https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?p=1997530|here|)

 - SWS/NF: Enable multichannel metering (all tracks)
 - SWS/NF: Enable multichannel metering (selected tracks)
 - SWS/NF: Cycle through MIDI recording modes (also available in ME section) (Issue 994)
 - SWS/NF: Cycle through track automation modes (Issue 995)
 - SWS/S&M: Show/Hide take ... envelope, SWS/S&M: Toggle show take ... envelope (unlike the native "Take: Toggle take ... envelope" actions these change visibility only) (Issue 1078)

Fixes:
+Issue 537: Snapshots: (Attempt to) Fix longstanding issue with send envelopes not restored when recalling snapshots (thanks ovnis for testing!)
 Note: Since snapshots are based on state chunks, changes within AI envelopes are not recalled currently (https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=205406|FR|), though AI properties (e.g. position) should be recalled correctly. Also note that when deleting an AI and trying to recall a previously stored snapshot which contains this AI it won't be recalled correctly.

!v2.8.0 featured build (August 13, 2015)
<strong>This new SWS version requires and supports REAPER v5.0+!</strong>
Lots of new features/fixes: everything listed below is new, down to v2.6 (all intermediate versions were pre-releases/beta/fixup builds).

New actions
+Main:
 - SWS/BR: Options - Automatically insert stretch markers when inserting tempo markers with SWS actions
  - Note:  The option is enabled by default. It allows for stretch markers to get automatically inserted when editing tempo map with various SWS/BR features (warp grid, freehand draw, tempo mapping). When appropriate, some of these features (i.e. warp grid) won't insert stretch markers in items with effective timebase time. See some examples http://stash.reaper.fm/24586/sws%20auto%20stretch%20markers.gif|here|
 - SWS/BR: Copy selected points in selected envelope to envelope at mouse cursor
 - SWS/BR: Copy points in time selection in selected envelope to envelope at mouse cursor
 - SWS/BR: Copy selected points in selected envelope to to envelope at mouse cursor (paste at edit cursor)
 - SWS/BR: Copy points in time selection in selected envelope to envelope at mouse cursor (paste at edit cursor)
 - SWS/BR: Options - Set "Run FX after stopping for" to x ms (various values)
 - SWS/BR: Toggle play from mouse cursor position
 - SWS/BR: Toggle play from mouse cursor position and solo active item's track for the duration
 - SWS/BR: Toggle play from mouse cursor position and solo active item for the duration

+Other:
 - Added toggle states to all actions for toggling toolbars

ReaScript
+Other:
 - BR_GetMouseCursorContext: fixed stretch marker detection when take had modified playrate

Fixes
+Fixed SWS/BR actions that show send envelopes. In certain corner cases they didn't work and could potentially remove FXs from receiving track
+Fixed SWS/BR actions that copy other stuff to envelopes (CC events, envelope points from other envelopes etc...) when dealing with FX envelopes

+Removed actions to simplify title bar. It wasn't reliable in certain situations and may not be morally right :)

!v2.7.1 pre-release build (May 7, 2015)
<strong>OSX:</strong>
+<strong>New installation disk image (.dmg)</strong>
 - The new .dmg proposes to install the SWS Extension in a different directory:
   /Library/Application Support/REAPER/UserPlugins (instead of ~/Library/Application Support/REAPER/UserPlugins)
 - This eases the installation ("normal" drag-drop .dmg, no more script), fixes some security issues, etc but has a small inconvenience when upgrading too, some information messages will guide you in this case though
 - More details http://forum.cockos.com/showpost.php?p=1518816&postcount=96|here|

+Issue 686: fixed new lines added in subtitles when saving the project

!v2.5.2 pre-release build (December 11, 2014)
<strong>REAPER v4.75+ is required!</strong>

Contextual toolbars
+Contextual toolbars dialog:
 - Added support for auto close:
  - If enabled, toolbar will automatically get closed after pressing any of it's buttons
  - Option exists separately for each context. To enable or disable the option, right-click or double click the <em>Auto close</em> column in the context list
  - Note that you can't set the option if context doesn't have a toolbar assigned to it
 - Added support for custom positioning of the toolbar:
  - There are two separate ways to set custom positioning of the toolbar:
   - Position override found in <em>Options</em> under group <em>All</em>. Enable to set where you want <strong>all the toolbars</strong> to appear in relation to mouse cursor.
   - Position offset that can be set up separately for each context. To set the option, right-click or double click the <em>Position offset</em> column in context list and type desired offset values
  - Setting one option doesn't exclude the other, they are cumulative.
  - If toolbar position is managed by Contextual toolbars, toolbar will never get displayed out of monitor bounds
  - Note that you can't set the option if context doesn't have a toolbar assigned to it
 -Other:
  - Previously, you always had to right-click the context list to edit it, now it's also possible to edit it by double clicking the cell
+Other:
 - Toolbars that are set to be <em>always on top</em> don't hide the tooltip anymore. Note that this works only for toolbars loaded by Contextual toolbars, the issue where REAPER hides tooltip behind pinned toolbar still exists and is reported http://forum.cockos.com/project.php?issueid=5199|here|
 - Renamed the actions <em>SWS/BR: <strong>Exclusive toggle</strong> contextual toolbar under mouse cursor, preset x</em> to <em>SWS/BR: <strong>Open/close</strong> contextual toolbar under mouse cursor, preset x</em>
 - Removed <em>Named notes mode</em> context from <em>Inline MIDI editor</em> group. It's currently not supported by REAPER and was mistakenly put there in the first place
+Added actions:
 - SWS/BR: Exclusive toggle contextual toolbar under mouse cursor, preset x (added in all sections: Main, MIDI editor, etc...)
  - Note: unlike other actions which simply close all toolbars if at least one of them is open, this will always open the contextual toolbar if valid toolbar is found for the context under mouse cursor. If found toolbar is already visible or no toolbar has been found, all toolbars will get closed

Analyze and normalize loudness
+Analyze loudness dialog:
 - Disable analyze button while analysis is progress

Added actions
+Main:
 - SWS/BR: Adjust playrate (MIDI CC only)
 - SWS/BR: Adjust playrate options...
  - Note: These two actions work in tandem. The first action changes playrate so you can automate it.The second action opens the dialog where you can set automatable playrate range. Also note that due to the API problems, actions can't respond to OSC, but in this case it shouldn't matter since you can configure REAPER OSC to manage playrate.

Fixes
+Resources: http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?p=1440002|fixed lost bookmarks|
+These actions now work properly when item is trimmed or stretched:
 - SWS/BR: Split selected items at stretch markers
 - SWS/BR: Create project markers from stretch markers in selected items
+Don't reload FX when undoing certain SWS actions

!v2.5.1 pre-release build (November 24, 2014)
<strong>REAPER v4.74+ is required!</strong>
New API functions were introduced in this version, they enable various improvements in the SWS/S&M Extension.
Thank you Cockos!

<strong>Contextual toolbars</strong>
+Functionality in general:
 - Feature relies heavily on existing REAPER toolbars. The basic concept is fairly simple. User assigns different REAPER toolbars to different contexts (things like TCP, item, piano roll, etc...) and loads them under mouse cursor by calling a single action. The action will then load an appropriate toolbar for a thing under the mouse cursor, http://wiki.cockos.com/wiki/images/3/3c/Contextual_toolbars_example.gif|like this.|
 - For more information, please http://wiki.cockos.com/wiki/index.php/Contextual_toolbars_with_SWS|visit the wiki on the subject| (which is also accessible from the Contextual toolbars dialog). In case you want to contribute to the wiki, you're more than welcome.
+Contextual toolbars dialog:
 - To open a dialog for setting up contextual toolbars either run the action SWS/BR: Contextual toolbars... or go to Main menu > Extensions > Contextual toolbars...
 - Dialog is divided into 3 parts, preset selector, list of possible contexts, and various options tied to those contexts. Select an arbitrary preset and right click contexts to assign them toolbars. Options can be found on the right and are executed only when toolbar is loaded. Once set up, use provided actions to load toolbars for each preset.
+Added actions:
  - SWS/BR: Contextual toolbars...
  - SWS/BR: Exclusive toggle contextual toolbar under mouse cursor, preset x (8 presets) (added in all sections: Main, MIDI editor, etc...)
   - Note: Actions work as toggle switches. If any of the toolbars set up in Contextual toolbars dialog is visible, all of them will get closed - otherwise toolbar corresponding to context under mouse cursor will get loaded.
+<strong>Feedback needed:</strong>
 - Note that while new contexts won't get added at this time (but fades and volume handles are planned) now is the time to help us. Any feedback, comments and criticism of current contexts hierarchy is highly welcome. For example, http://wiki.cockos.com/wiki/index.php/Contextual_toolbars_with_SWS#Special_cases:_item_stretch_markers_and_take_envelopes|this workaround| would definitely benefit from discussion. Don't hesitate to express your opinion on http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=150702|dedicated forum topic.| Thanks!

Analyze and normalize loudness
+Analyze loudness dialog:
 - Analyzer can now measure true peak (disabled by default since it prolongs analysis due to resampling - see Options to enable/disable)
  - Double-click true peak cell to move edit cursor to true peak location (or right-click selected item/track in list view to reveal the option)
 - Added user preference to display either LUFS or LU (see Options->Unit).
  - To set reference level for 0 LU and formatting of LU unit, see Options->Global preferences (or run SWS/BR: Global loudness preferences)
  - Right-click menu entry for normalizing follows Options->Unit and will alternate between "Normalize to -23 LUFS" and "Normalize to 0 LU"
  - Normalizing to specific value can normalize to both LUFS and LU
 - Export list of analyzed items/tracks to clipboard or file
  - To export the list, select items in list view, right-click them and select "Export formated list to clipboard/file"
  - For setting the format of exported items, see Options->Export format
   - Formating supports wildcards. Wildcards description can be found in the same dialog. To hide description, simply resize the dialog
   - Besides typing, wildcards can also be inserted using the "Wildcard" button.
   - Previously used format patterns are stored in the "Wildcard" button submenu
 - Analyzed objects are now restored on project load
 - Other:
  - Right-click menu entry for creating loudness graph no longer queries range, instead it uses range set in Options->Global preferences (or SWS/BR: Global loudness preferences)
  - Normalize dialog is no longer modal (but will be closed if loudness analyzer is closed/hidden to avoid confusion)
  - Display new items/tracks in list view as soon as they're analyzed
  - Analyze button changes caption depending on what is to be analyzed
  - Added Help... menu entry to options menus

Other:
+Renamed FNG MIDI actions in Main section (remove MIDI prefix and added "in active MIDI editor" description at the end)
+Capitalized certain FNG actions names

+Fixed undo in certain instances when moving grid to mouse cursor

!v2.4.0 #5 pre-release build (March 30, 2014)
<strong>Analyze and normalize loudness</strong>
+Functionality in general:
 - Loudness is measured according to EBU 3342 standard thanks to excellent http://github.com/jiixyj/libebur128|libebur128| by Jan Kokemuller
 - Due to <strong>limitations in Reaper API</strong>, we can extract audio data only from certain parts of the audio chain. Chart can be found http://wiki.cockos.com/wiki/images/5/50/SWS_loudness_analysis_signal_flow_chart.png|here|. A few gotchas:
   - You can't use item fades for extensive volume control
   - If you need to use FX, current workaround is to put one item with needed FX in an empty track and measure that track
+Added actions:
 - SWS/BR: Normalize loudness of selected items/tracks...
 - SWS/BR: Normalized loudness of selected items/tracks to -23 LUFS
 - SWS/BR: Analyze loudness...
+Analyze loudness dialog:
 - Accessible from the Action list or Main menu > Extensions > Loudness...
 - Right-click on the dialog or just click "Options" button for various settings
 - Measures integrated, range, short-term and momentary loudness of selected items and tracks
 - To normalize items or tracks, right-click analyzed targets in the list view - often faster than using separate actions because data for already analyzed targets in the dialog is cached (to prevent needles reanalyzing before normalization if nothing changed)
 - Draw momentary and short-term loudness graph to selected envelope. Right-clicking analyzed item should reveal the feature. You can use dummy JS effects from http://stash.reaper.fm/v/20187/SWS%20dummy%20loudness%20graph|here| as a canvas for loudness graphs
 - After the target is analyzed, it's possible to position edit cursor over maximum short-term and momentary loudness interval by double-clicking cells holding their measurements. There is also an option to create time selection over that part of the item/track.
 - Dialog is designed to follow project state. If you rename or delete analyzed target, the change will get reflected in the dialog. For various settings relating to this, check dialog options
 - Analyzing happens in a separate thread so user is free to keep on using Reaper while it's happening.

Warp grid
+SWS/BR: Move closest grid line/tempo marker to mouse cursor:
 - Prevent creating multiple undo points while shortcut is kept on being pressed
 - Smoother reaction to mouse movements, not depending on the OS keyboard settings anymore
 - While the shortcut is pressed, target grid gets "locked" to mouse so it isn't possible to accidentally edit surrounding grids
 - Change mouse cursor when using the action (win only)
 - Improved efficiency when dealing with high tempo marker count
 - Note: due to the way upper improvements are made, you can't arm the action from the toolbar (as some users are doing http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?p=1332827#post1332827|here|). If you really need that, you can create a separate macro just for that:
     - SWS/BR Save edit cursor position, slot x
     - View: Move edit cursor to mouse cursor (no snapping)
     - SWS/BR: Move closest grid to edit cursor
     - SWS/BR Restore edit cursor position, slot x
+Added actions:
 - SWS/BR: Move closest (measure) grid line to edit/play cursor (Issue 638)
 - SWS/BR: Move closest left/right side grid line to edit cursor

Project startup action
+Added "SWS/S&M: Show project startup action"
+Added dedicated menu items in Main menu > Extensions > Project startup action (for easier set-up)
+The action (and new menu item) "SWS/S&M: Set project startup action" now prompts to overwrite

Cycle actions
+Added "LOOP x" statement (thanks wol!): prompts the user for the number of times to repeat something
+Tiny fixes (corner cases)

Marker list
+Export formatted marker list to clipboard now works on OSX

Added actions
+SWS/wol: Set "Vertical zoom center" to "Track at center of view"
+SWS/wol: Set "Vertical zoom center" to "Top visible track
+SWS/wol: Set "Vertical zoom center" to "Last selected track"
+SWS/wol: Set "Vertical zoom center" to "Track under mouse cursor"
+SWS/wol: Set "Horizontal zoom center" to "Edit cursor or play cursor (default)"
+SWS/wol: Set "Horizontal zoom center" to "Edit cursor"
+SWS/wol: Set "Horizontal zoom center" to "Center of view"
+SWS/wol: Set "Horizontal zoom center" to "Mouse cursor"
+SWS/BR: Copy take media source file path of selected items to clipboard
+SWS/BR: Toggle "Playback position follows project timebase when changing tempo"
+SWS/BR: Move closest (selected) envelope point to edit cursor
+SWS/BR: Insert 2 envelopes points at time selection

Added ReaScript functions
+ULT_GetMediaItemNote
+ULT_SetMediaItemNote

Fixes
+The action "SWS/BR: Delete tempo marker and preserve position and length of (selected) items (including MIDI events)" should now work properly
 - Note: due to bug in the API, please update to 4.611 otherwise you will lose any text and sysex events
+Fixed rounding issues when converting projects markers to tempo markers in time selection (reported http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?p=1330369#post1330369|here|)

!v2.4.0 #4 (March 13, 2014)
<strong>REAPER v4.60+ is required!</strong>
New API functions were introduced in this version, they enable various improvements in the SWS/S&M Extension.
Thank you Cockos!

Added actions
+SWS/BR: Preview media item under mouse (versions for pausing project playback during preview)
+SWS/BR: Toggle media item online/offline
+SWS/BR: Set selected envelope points to next/previous point's value
+SWS/BR: Set selected envelope points to first/last selected point's value
+SWS/BR: Delete tempo marker while preserving position and length of (selected) items (including MIDI events)
+SWS/BR: Move closest tempo marker to mouse cursor
+SWS/BR: Move closest (measure) grid line to mouse cursor (may create tempo marker)
 Hint: There is an interesting effect if you keep shortcut key pressed while moving the mouse - grid/tempo marker will follow it.
 The only con is that a bunch of undo points will get created
+Added stock toggle actions:
 - SWS/S&M: Dummy toggle n (where 'n' is in [1; 8], http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?p=984786#post984786|customizable in the S&M.ini file|, up to 99 toggles)
 - SWS/S&M: Exclusive toggle An (where 'n' is in [1; 4], http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?p=984786#post984786|customizable in the S&M.ini file|, up to 99 toggles)
 - SWS/S&M: Exclusive toggle Bn (where 'n' is in [1; 4])
 - SWS/S&M: Exclusive toggle Cn (where 'n' is in [1; 4])
 - SWS/S&M: Exclusive toggle Dn (where 'n' is in [1; 4])
   "Exclusive toggle" means only one toggle action is ON at a time.
   For ex: in the set of toggles "A", if "Exclusive toggle A03" is ON, A01 A02 and A04 are OFF.
   These actions come in handy with Cycle Actions for example, see details and use-cases http://forum.cockos.com/showpost.php?p=1315222&postcount=1652|here| (thanks Reno.thestraws!)

Resources: auto-save media files improvements

ReaConsole
+Issue 588: added option in the context menu to invert ENTER and  CRTL+ENTER (CMD+ENTER on OS X) key shortcuts:
 - The ENTER key can either perform commands and let the console open, while CRTL+ENTER performs commands but closes it
   Useful when ReaConsole is docked for example, default behavior
 - Or the ENTER key can perform commands and close the console, while CRTL+ENTER performs commands but let it open
   Useful when using ReaConsole the old-school way, as a dialog box
+New default shortcut 'c' to open ReaConsole ('C' might conflict with the native action "Insert time signature/tempo Marker")

Cycle actions
+Issue 634: our new project member wol has added some conditional statements, thanks!
 - IF AND: if both next actions are ON
 - IF NAND: if at least 1 of the next 2 actions is OFF
 - IF OR: if at least 1 of the next 2 actions is ON
 - IF NOR: if both next actions are OFF
 - IF XOR: if the next 2 actions' states are different
 - IF XNOR: if the next 2 actions' states are the same
 Note: these new statements must be followed by <strong>two</strong> actions that report a toggle state
+Editor: commands indentation
+Editor: better description of conditional statements (in plain English)
+Tweaks: better context menu, message dialog box, etc

Added ReaScript functions
+BR_GetMouseCursorContext
+BR_GetMouseCursorContext_Envelope

<strong>MIDI/OSC actions support learn with both MIDI Pitch and "normalized" OSC messages</strong>
+To enable this new option: set "LearnPitchAndNormOSC" to 1 in the section [General] of the S&M.ini file (quit REAPER first!)
+When the new option is enabled, all actions of the section "S&M Extension" can be learned with:
 - <strong>New:</strong> OSC messages with floating-point argument in [0, 1] (14-bit resolution)
   Useful for OSC controllers that cannot handle absolute float values, e.g. <strong>TouchOSC for Android needs this!</strong>
 - <strong>New:</strong> MIDI Pitch messages (14-bit resolution)
 - MIDI CC messages (absolute and relative modes, as usual)

Region Playlist
+<strong>Fixed playback that could get out of sync randomly</strong>
+Added option "Smooth seek (seek immediately if disabled)" in the context menu, details http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=128371|here|

Auto color/icon
+Issue 602: Marker/region rules now support the filters (any) and (unnamed)
+Issue 600 / Windows OS: fixed potential crash when changing colors
+Fixed marker/region auto-coloring rules not obeying priorities

Cycle Actions
+Cycle Actions now support all 3rd party extensions' actions
+Issue 607: better recursion detection/protection, thanks Big Bob!
+Editor: reject unreliable command ids for SWS actions, macros and scripts

Notes window
+Make it possible to monitor/edit marker/region names and subtitles separately,
 i.e. added "Marker names", "Marker subtitles", "Region names" and "Region subtitles"
 in the dropdown box (in addition to "Marker/region names" and "Marker/region subtitles")
+Added related actions:
 - SWS/S&M: Open/close Notes window (marker names)
 - SWS/S&M: Open/close Notes window (region names)
 - SWS/S&M: Open/close Notes window (marker subtitles)
 - SWS/S&M: Open/close Notes window (region subtitles)
+If REAPER >= v4.55: Mark project dirty (needing save) rather than creating undo points for each key stroke
+Potential fix for http://forum.cockos.com/showpost.php?p=1180135&postcount=1595|"things that smells like Pont-l'�v�que"|
+House cleaning: allow notes for macros and scripts (aka "Action help")
 To easy copy/paste, string identifiers used to be displayed in the Notes window for macros/scripts.
 This is now useless since the action list offers "Copy selected action cmdID/identifier string".

Resources / Issue 591: make it possible to save and use new slots/files only via user macros (w/o tweaking the S&M.ini file, etc..)
+Made "Auto-save" slots/files <em>actions</em> more macro-friendly: they won't prompt for anything
 Note: the "Auto-save" <em>button</em> still prompt to overwrite selected slots/files
+Added a "last slot" version for all existing slot actions (i.e. new actions to deal with "auto-saved slots")
 A few examples:
 - SWS/S&M: Resources - Apply track template to selected tracks, <em>last slot</em>
 - SWS/S&M: Resources - Apply track template (+envelopes/items) to selected tracks, <em>last slot</em>
 - SWS/S&M: Resources - Import tracks from track template, <em>last slot</em>
 - etc..
+Added actions to cleanup things at the end of user macros, if needed:
 - SWS/S&M: Resources - Delete last track template slot/file
 - SWS/S&M: Resources - Delete last FX chain slot/file
 - SWS/S&M: Resources - Delete last media slot/file
 - SWS/S&M: Resources - Delete last project slot/file
 - SWS/S&M: Resources - Delete last theme slot/file
 - SWS/S&M: Resources - Delete last image slot/file

Resources: other updates
+Tag bookmark names with [x] when relevant slot actions are attached to them
+Media files: added "Add media file" options in the context menu (+ related actions)
 - Stretch/loop to fit time selection
 - Try to match tempo 0.5x
 - Try to match tempo 1x
 - Try to match tempo 2x
 <strong>Note: all existing "Add media file" slot actions obey these new options too</strong>
+Track templates: fixed the option "Offset items/envelopes by edit cursor" not being obeyed, sometimes
+Track templates: added actions where 'n' is in [1; 4], http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?p=984786#post984786|customizable in the S&M.ini file|:
 - SWS/S&M: Resources - Paste (replace) template items to selected tracks, slot n
 - SWS/S&M: Resources - Paste (replace) template items to selected tracks, last slot
 - SWS/S&M: Resources - Paste template items to selected tracks, slot n
 - SWS/S&M: Resources - Paste template items to selected tracks, last slot
+GUI tweaks, better wordings and undo point names (with slot numbers), etc..
+<strong>House cleaning: Removed all "prompt for slot" actions (*)</strong>
 Prehistoric actions that used to make sense when there was no dedicated GUI...
+<strong>House cleaning: Deprecated the "project loader/selecter" tool (*)</strong>
 This tool was useful to switch projects or select project tabs (during live performances, for ex.)
 Instead, you can just create a new dedicated bookmark (say "Live projects": click the tiny button +),
 add projects to it (drag-drop RPP files from an Explorer/Finder), and attach relevant slot actions to
 it via the context menu > Bookmark > Attach project slot actions to this bookmark.
 Deprecated actions have been replaced as follow:
 - "Resources - Project loader/selecter: next (cycle)"  ->  "Resources - Open project, next slot (cycle)"
 - "Resources - Project loader/selecter: previous (cycle)"  ->  "Resources - Open project, previous slot (cycle)"
 Also added:
 - SWS/S&M: Resources - Open project, next slot (new tab, cycle)
 - SWS/S&M: Resources - Open project, previous slot (new tab, cycle)
+(*) If you have any trouble because of that, please http://code.google.com/p/sws-extension/issues/list|say something|!

Fixed some actions learned with <strong>relative</strong> MIDI CC events
+SWS/S&M: Select project (MIDI CC/OSC only)
+SWS/S&M: Trigger preset for FX n of selected track (MIDI CC/OSC only) - where 'n' is in [1; 8]
 Note: FX 4 to FX 8 are new actions
+SWS/S&M: Trigger preset for selected FX of selected track (MIDI CC/OSC only)
+Reminder: those actions belong to the section "S&M extension" of the action list (top-right dropdown box)

Live Configs:
+Allow switches to "comments-only" configs (e.g. OSC feedback with random/custom strings)
+Added actions (where 'n' is in [1; 4], http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?p=984786#post984786|customizable in the S&M.ini file|):
 - SWS/S&M: Live Config n - Preload next config
 - SWS/S&M: Live Config n - Preload previous config
 Notes: useful to preload configs with -/+ controllers (like pedals), there already are similar actions to switch to the next/previous config

Resources window:
+Improved context menus (right-click the bookmark dropdown box, the attached project label, etc..)
+OS X: Context menu > "Edit file..." opens files with the default text editor (like on Windows OS)

ReaScript function export:
+Truncate or delete midi notes which go past the all-notes-off event
+ConfigVar functions now cover global MIDI preferences too (in case it works on REAPER's end someday)

+SWS/BR: Increase/decrease tempo marker:
 - fixed unresponsiveness in certain corner-cases involving square points
 - fixed behavior for consequential selections
+SWS/BR: Alter slope of gradual tempo marker:

Enabled more code optimizations on Windows builds to increase action speed in some cases, especially with x64.

!v2.3.0 #19 (June 27, 2013)
Fixes:
+Issue 585 / OS X: fixed font rendering crashes, thank YOU Justin!
+More screenset fixes (including http://code.google.com/p/sws-extension/source/detail?r=1077|these issues|)

Added actions:
+SWS/BR: Hide all but active track envelope (issue 456)

Other:
+<strong>Renamed a bunch of S&M "slot actions" to make it clear they are attached to the Resources window</strong>
 For ex.: <em>SWS/S&M: Import tracks from track template, slot 3</em> has been renamed into <em>SWS/S&M: <strong>Resources - </strong>Import tracks from track template, slot 3</em>
+Cycle Action editor: display unregistered cycle actions as such (IDs in parenthesis)
+Actions that renumber marker/region IDs now create undo points

!v2.3.0 #18 (June 9, 2013)
Issue 517 / Windows OS: S&M actions and commands that open the Explorer now also reveal files
OS X: better fonts in S&M windows (again!)

+Resources/Windows OS: fixed "Edit file..."
+Issue 576: fixed auto-icon crash
+Issue 581 / OS X port: the action "SWS/S&M: Set project startup action" now prompts for a command ID or an identifier string
 (to copy such IDs, right-click an action in the Actions window > Copy selected action cmdID/identifier string)

!v2.3.0 #17 (April 30, 2013)
<strong>REAPER v4.33+ is required!</strong>
New API functions were introduced in this version, they enable various improvements in the SWS/S&M Extension.
Thank you Cockos!

Cycle Action (CA)
+Cycle Actions for all sections (Media Explorer, Inline MIDI Editor, etc..)
+Support macros & scripts in all sections
+Improved the timing of Cycle Actions (again!)
+Support special macros using actions like "No-op", "Wait n seconds before next action", etc..
+Editor: various usability improvements, incl. a bit of issue 565
+Editor / Issue 562: added instruction LABEL to run Label Processor commands (and make your own "Label Processor actions")
 Example: LABEL /Lmy_suffix
 Reminder: the syntax is described in Main menu > Extensions > Label Processor
+Editor: fixed paranoid test that was preventing some valid CAs to be registered, thanks Big Bob!
+Fixed possible "no-op" CAs in the Action list

Resources window and related "slot actions"
+<strong>Issue 560: added commands and options to attach/detach resource files to/from projects</strong>
 When saving your work to another directory (using save as/copy media), all files that have been attached to the project in the Resources window will be backed up too.
 When a bookmark is attached to a project, any file/slot that will be added to (or removed from) this bookmark will be automatically attached to (or detached from) the project.
 Use-case examples: Comping, http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=121131|"Revolver tracks"|
 - Added Context menu > Bookmark > "Attach bookmark to X.RPP" and "Detach bookmark from Y.RPP"
 - Added option "Attach bookmark to this project" when creating new bookmarks
 - Added label for the attached project name (if any), right-click to load/select the said project
+<strong>Added custom bookmarks</strong>: Context menu > Bookmark > New bookmark > Custom...
 The definition format is: resource_directory_name,description,file_extensions (no spaces around commas)
 - Example1: Configurations,ReaConfig,ReaperConfigZip
   => Bank of configs example: auto-fill, then double-click slots to switch ReaConfigs (or, on Win, drag-drop slots to the arrange)
 - Example2: Docs,Document,txt,rtf,pdf => Multiple file extensions example
 - Example3: Misc,Any file,* => Can be useful to attach any type of file to a project, for example
+<strong>Theme bookmarks and related slots actions: OS X port + now support both .ReaperthemeZip and .ReaperTheme files</strong>
 For Mac users, an interesting new action is "SWS/S&M: Load theme, slot n" - where 'n' is in [1; 4], http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?p=984786#post984786|customizable in the S&M.ini file|: up to 99 themes
+Image bookmarks and related slots actions now support the same image formats than REAPER: PNG, JPG, BMP, etc..
 Note: Image bookmarks were limited to PNG files before this version (only the action "SWS/S&M: Show image, slot n" is still limited to PNG)
+Project bookmarks and related slots actions now support the same project files than REAPER: RPP, EDL, RPP-BAK, etc..
 Note: Project bookmarks were limited to RPP files before this version
+Context menus: new commands
+Various tweaks, tiny fixes (localization, media file filters, etc..)

Fixes:
+Notes window: undoing "remove tracks" now restores tracks notes, if any
+Removed default shortcut Ctrl+Shift+M ("SWS: Open marker list"): conflict with the default/native shortcut for "View: show track manager window"
+Removed default shortcut Ctrl+F (for "SWS/S&M: Find"): no known conflict but more future-proof
+Screenset load now sets size/position of undocked SWS windows as reported http://forum.cockos.com/showpost.php?p=1158117&postcount=1248|here|

!v2.3.0 #16 (April 18, 2013)
Added H:M:S.F to marker list export format

Fixes:
+Fixed screensets broken in v2.3.0 #15
+OS X now supports all track template files, thanks mustgroove!
 This fixes this http://forum.cockos.com/showpost.php?p=1157294&postcount=31|Resources window issue| (and probably other things on OS X)
+Issue 552: auto-saved track templates now sync to tempo (i.e. added beat information in auto-saved templates)

!v2.3.0 #15 (April 8, 2013)
Live Configs:
+Added basic OSC feedback
 To bind an OSC device: Live Configs window > Context menu > OSC feedback, and choose a device in the list
 Devices listed there are the OSC "control surfaces" defined in Options > Preferences > Control Surfaces
 Note: only the name, IP, max packet size and output port parameters are required.
 Unless you need REAPER feedback as well, you do not need to tick the option "Send to port"
 Up to 4 OSC devices are managed, i.e. distinct feedback for Live Config #1, #2, #3 and #4
 The possible OSC messages (with string arguments) are:
 - /snm/liveconfig<strong>n</strong>/current/changed - when the active config changed for the Live Config #<strong>n</strong>
 - /snm/liveconfig<strong>n</strong>/current/changing - when the active config is changing for the Live Config #<strong>n</strong> (same as grayed display in monitoring windows)
 - /snm/liveconfig<strong>n</strong>/preload/changed - when the preloaded config changed for the Live Config #<strong>n</strong>
 - /snm/liveconfig<strong>n</strong>/preload/changing - when the active config is changing for the Live Config #<strong>n</strong> (same as grayed display in monitoring windows)
+Fixed ~1s delay when switching configs (with the option "Send all notes off when switching configs"), thanks Breeder!
+Undoing config switches now properly update monitoring windows
 Note: just fixed for the sake of it as it is recommended to disable undo points for live performances!

Region Playlist:
+Support main transport pause
 Before this version the playlist was stopped on pause, now it just plays again when "un-pausing", as expected
+Added basic OSC feedback
 To bind an OSC device, etc.. see above: same as the Live Configs' OSC feedback
 The possible OSC messages (with string arguments) are:
 - /snm/rgnplaylist/current - current region
 - /snm/rgnplaylist/next - next region

Added actions:
+SWS: Set takes in selected item(s) to random custom color(s)
+SWS: Set takes in selected item(s) to color gradient
+SWS: Set takes in selected item(s) to ordered custom colors
+SWS/BR: Create tempo markers at grid after every selected tempo marker
+Issue 180:
 - SWS/BR: Create project markers from selected items (name by item's notes)
 - SWS/BR: Create regions from selected items (name by item's notes)

Fixes:
+About box: fixed update checker connection issues in certain instances (Win only)
+Cycle actions: fixed ReaScript support broken in v2.3.0 #14, thanks gofer!
+OS X x64: fixed font rendering crash (when using alpha)
+Fixed crazy behavior (SWS stops working) when running these actions on empty items:
 - SWS/BR: Create project markers from notes in selected MIDI items
 - SWS/FNG: legato selected media items on same track (change rate)
 - SWS/FNG: Time compress/stretch selected items
+Refresh arrange after running SWS/FNG: unselect items that do not start in time selection
+Prevent loss of item selection when running Xenakios/SWS: Remove muted items
+Small rename (for the sake of clarity) of 2 actions: Xenakios/SWS: Shuffle order of selected items
+Don't skip last fade shape when using Xenakios/SWS: Set next/previous fade in/out shape for items
+More consistent behavior for:
 - Xenakios/SWS: Explode selected items to new tracks (keeping positions)
 - Xenakios/SWS: Select takes in selected items, shuffled random
 - Xenakios/SWS: Select takes of selected items cyclically
+These actions now work with empty items (issue 281):
 - SWS: Create regions from sel item(s) named with take
 - Xenakios/SWS: Create markers from selected items (name by take source file name)
 - Xenakios/SWS: Explode selected items to new tracks (keeping positions)
 - Xenakios/SWS: Remove muted items
 - Xenakios/SWS: Reverse order of selected items
 - Xenakios/SWS: Shuffle order of selected items
 - Xenakios/SWS: Shuffle order of selected items (2)
 - Xenakios/SWS: Select items under edit cursor on selected tracks
 - Xenakios/SWS: Time selection adaptive delete
 - Xenakios/SWS: Toggle selected items selected randomly

Other:
+OS X: better font rendering

!v2.3.0 #14 (March 23, 2013)
Cycle Actions (CAs)
+Improved timing when performing CAs
+Issue 550: CAs can now contain <em>other</em> CAs, recursively
+The character comma (,) can now be used in CONSOLE instructions
+Added instruction ELSE
+Improved toggle states reporting
 - CAs can now either report fake toggle states (like it was before v2.3.0 #9) or real ones (i.e. toggle state of the first relevant "sub-action")
   This ensures transparent upgrades from older versions. This toggle state is configurable in the column "Toggle" of the editor, <strong>see details http://forum.cockos.com/showpost.php?p=1090262&postcount=1136|here|</strong>
 - Better initialization for CAs that report real toggle states (i.e. <strong>avoid to run some of them one time before they sync properly</strong>)
+Editor: display MIDI action names (with REAPER >= v4.33pre16)
+Editor: new menu items to cut/copy/paste commands (works across CAs)
+Editor: new menu item to explode CAs, custom actions (i.e. macros) and ReaConsole actions into individual actions
 <strong>This helps sharing Cycle Actions with other users, see important remarks http://forum.cockos.com/showpost.php?p=1170459&postcount=1267|here|</strong>
 (before this version you probably had to share other files, now you just have to export a single file where all CAs have been "exploded")
+Editor tweaks: added CA text filter, more helpful messages (again), etc...
+Fixed missing undo points for CONSOLE commands (when the option "Consolidate undo points" was disabled)
+Removed "cycling tooltips" (when CAs were attached to toolbar buttons, the reason why is detailed http://forum.cockos.com/showpost.php?p=1212048&postcount=1331|here|)
 Note: when the opetion "Consolidate undo points" is enabled, steps like !bla or !foo still provide distinct undo point names though ("Undo foo", "Undo bla")

Live Configs
+Ignore preload over the current/active track
+Improved action learn: prompt to replace current bindings or to add a new binding (with REAPER >= v4.33pre20)
+Monitoring windows: improved redraw + click the "CURRENT" panel to show/hide the "PRELOAD" one
+Fixed Cut command and corner-cases

Snapshot improvements: (Thanks for the contributions, Chris!)
+Added Previous and Next buttons for navigating snapshots and added associated actions
+Added Move Up & Down buttons for re-ordering snapshots list and added similar actions
+Added Notes field (limited to 100 characters)
+Changed the way snapshots are deleted so the sort column remains continuously numbered

Added actions:
+Issue 543: SWS/S&M: Go to/select region n (obeys smooth seek)
 where 'n' is in [1; 4], http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?p=984786#post984786|customizable in the S&M.ini file|: up to 99 actions/regions
+Issue 307: actions to increase/decrease the metronome volume (by steps of ~ 0.15dB)
 SWS/S&M: Increase metronome volume
 SWS/S&M: Decrease metronome volume
+SWS/BR: Move closest tempo marker to edit cursor

Other:
+"SWS: Minimize selected track(s)" now returns a toggle state:
 reports ON if the selected track (or all selected tracks) is (are) minimized
+ReaConcole: reduced minimum height and margins
+S&M project startup actions: tweaks to support theme switching on project load (details http://forum.cockos.com/showpost.php?p=1140973&postcount=18|here|)

Fixes:
+<strong>S&M Notes window / OS X 10.7+: fixed refresh issues, thanks chriscomfort!</strong>
+OS X 10.7+ x64: fixed list views being right aligned
+All S&M windows: fixed button display for some themes (e.g. http://forum.cockos.com/showpost.php?p=1124199&postcount=169|Apollo theme|)
+Fixed action "SWS/S&M: Open project path in explorer/finder"
 This action was opening the project's parent folder, not the project's folder
+About box: fixed disabled button in update checker in certain instances
+ReaMote: fixed unexpected "Version Incompatibility" error message

!v2.3.0 #13 (February 2, 2013)
ReaConsole updates
+Create actions made of console commands directly in the Cycle Action editor, see below + example and details http://forum.cockos.com/showpost.php?p=1115796&postcount=1179|here|
 In other words, to create your own console actions, <strong>you do not need to create/tweak a text file anymore</strong> (i.e. reaconsole_customcommands.txt)
 => better action names, for example: a custom "Select bass tracks" instead of "SWS: Run console command: s*bass*"
 => simpler configuration (no file edition/re-start)
 => benefit from other Cycle Actions' features: toggle state reporting, etc..
 => indirectly fixes little issues on OS X
 Note: although it is deprecated now, the file reaconsole_customcommands.txt still parsed for ascendant compatibility
+<strong>New command 'x' to add track FX</strong> by names, see examples and details http://forum.cockos.com/showpost.php?p=1115796&postcount=1179|here|
 Note: the command will do nothing if the FX is already present
+<strong>New command '/' to send local OSC messages</strong> (as if they were sent by a device on the network), see examples and details http://forum.cockos.com/showpost.php?p=1115796&postcount=1179|here|
 Longer console commands.. but this opens a bunch of doors: receives, sends, FX parameters, FX presets, etc..
+Issue 484: the ReaConsole window is now modeless, dockable, resizable, etc..
 <strong>=> key shortcuts swap!</strong>
 - The ENTER key runs a command and now keeps the Console window open
 - CTRL+ENTER (CMD+ENTER on OS X) will now close the Console window after running a command
+Fixed a few console commands' undo points that were ignored

Cycle Action editor updates
+Added instruction CONSOLE to run ReaConsole commands, see example and details http://forum.cockos.com/showpost.php?p=1115796&postcount=1179|here|
 Example: CONSOLE x ReaComp
 Reminder: the syntax of ReaConsole commands is detailed http://www.standingwaterstudios.com/reaconsole.php|here|
+More helpful messages
+Improved toggle states for cycle actions using instructions IF and IF NOT

Ported more features to OS X:
+<strong>Theme helpers for OS X</strong> (actions referenced in the http://www.houseofwhitetie.com/reaper/walter_themers_guide.pdf|WALTER user manual|):
 - SWS/S&M: Show theme helper (all tracks)
 - SWS/S&M: Show theme helper (selected tracks)
+More toolbar auto-refresh actions:
 - SWS/S&M: Toolbar - Toggle offscreen item selection (top)
 - SWS/S&M: Toolbar - Toggle offscreen item selection (bottom)
+More CMD+A support in text fields (select all)

Issue 524: new actions to detect and unselect offscreen items (just to unify the 4 existing actions "Toggle offscreen item selection (left/right/top/bottom)")
+SWS/S&M: Unselect offscreen items
+SWS/S&M: Toolbar - Toggle offscreen item selection
 This one deselects offscreen items and reselects them on toggle
+Reminder: toolbar buttons of those actions automatically light-up when at least one selected item is offscreen
 (the option "Main menu > Extensions > SWS options > Auto-refresh toolbars" must be enabled)

Other:
+Cue buss dialog box: key shortcuts pass through to the main window
+Fixed potential issues with relative paths like "./stuff.rpp"

!v2.3.0 #12 (January 30, 2013)
Automatic check for updates:
+Option can be found in REAPER > Extensions > About SWS Extensions
 - Performed once per day (startup check is silent, user gets notified only if new version is available)
 - Turned on by default for official updates
 - When searching manually (instead of startup search) both official and beta updates are checked

Tempo improvements:
+Convert project markers to tempo markers:
 - More sane results when creating gradual tempo changes (thanks to middle points)
 - Option to split middle point into 2 points to smooth things out
+Added actions:
 - SWS/BR: Randomize selected tempo markers...
 - SWS/BR: Delete tempo marker (preserve overall tempo and positions if possible)
 - SWS/BR: Set tempo marker shape to linear (preserve positions)
 - SWS/BR: Set tempo marker shape to square (preserve positions)
 - SWS/BR: Set tempo marker shape (options)...
 - SWS/BR: Increase/Decrease tempo marker (preserve it's time position) (% and BPM versions)
   => These actions are mostly intended for manipulation of linear (gradual) tempo. See documentation for more
 - SWS/BR: Alter slope of gradual tempo marker (increase/decrease) (% and BPM versions)
   => As the name suggest, these actions work only on gradual tempo markers. See documentation for more
 - SWS/BR: Create project markers from selected tempo markers
 - SWS/BR: Create project markers from notes in selected MIDI items
+Other:
 - All dialogs under SWS/BR:
     - Options are preserved through sessions
     - Tiny OS X cosmetic fixes
 - All existing tempo operations should be much faster when dealing with a lot of points
 - Tiny renames of move actions for easier readability
 - Documentations available on http://wiki.cockos.com/wiki/index.php/Category:Tempo|wiki.cockos.com|, namely http://wiki.cockos.com/wiki/index.php/Tempo-mapping_in_Reaper|here| and http://wiki.cockos.com/wiki/index.php/Tweaking_tempo|here|

Added actions:
+Issue 544: SWS/S&M: Set project startup action (and SWS/S&M: Clear project startup action)
 Note: startup actions are defined <strong>per project</strong>. If you need to run an action when launching REAPER (or with new blank projects),
 define a project template (in Preferences > Project) and a startup action for this template.
+SWS/BR: Check for new SWS version...

Fix for OSC & MIDI CC relative "mode 3" learn

!v2.3.0 #11 (January 15, 2013)
Fix for snapshot merge crash

!v2.3.0 #10 (January 11, 2013)
Live Configs: support OSC and rotary controllers
+Improved the "learnability" of the following actions of the "S&M Extension" section, they have been renamed accordingly:
 - SWS/S&M: Apply Live Config n (MIDI CC absolute only)  ->  SWS/S&M: Apply Live Config n (MIDI CC/OSC only)
 - SWS/S&M: Preload Live Config n (MIDI CC absolute only) ->  SWS/S&M: Preload Live Config n (MIDI CC/OSC only)
+Support all types of MIDI CC controllers (like endless rotary encoders)
 - In addition to the "Absolute" mode, all "Relative" modes of the Learn dialog box are now supported too
 - Acceleration is also supported
+Support OSC learn (OSC message with float parameter)
 - Example: say you have learned the action "SWS/S&M: Apply Live Config 3 (MIDI CC/OSC only)" with the OSC message "/blabla",
   sending "/blabla/f/107.0" will switch to the instrument/effect #107 of the Live Config #3

Added actions (http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?p=984786#post984786|customizable in the S&M.ini file|):
+SWS/S&M: Bypass all FX (except n) for selected tracks - where 'n' is in [1; 8] by default
 - Might be useful for FX comparisons (A/B)
+SWS/S&M: Set all FX (except n) offline for selected tracks - where 'n' is in [1; 8] by default
 - Might be useful for live applications
The following new actions are a bit specific, so they are <strong>hidden by default</strong> (n=0 in the S&M.ini file)
+SWS/S&M: Unbypass all FX (except n) for selected tracks
+SWS/S&M: Set all FX (except n) online for selected tracks
+SWS/S&M: Dummy toggle n
 - These actions just report a toggle state
+SWS/S&M: Exclusive toggle n
 - These actions just report a toggle state, only one of them is ON at a time (all others are automatically turned OFF)

ReaScript:
+Added function SNM_AddTCPFXParm()
+Hardened http://forum.cockos.com/showpost.php?p=1099358&postcount=1162|SNM_TieResourceSlotActions()|

Auto color/icon:
+Fixed color edition in place in the list view
+Fixed possible crash when the extension is localized

Other:
+Updated action "Xenakios/SWS: Randomize item positions...":
 - Added an option to move all grouped items by the same amount
+All actions of the "S&M Extension" section now support OSC and rotary controllers

!v2.3.0 #9 (December 23, 2012)
<strong>Live Configs: big overhaul, merged a dedicated extension plugin.</strong>
The fine details will be posted in this http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?p=1079515#post1079515|thread/PDF| (not up-to-date yet!), in the meantime major changes are:
+New "core" to ensure smooth/glitch-free config switches, new "All notes off" logic (now optional)
+Added Preload feature: you can prepare an instrument/effect while playing another
 This can be done with a second controller (click the new "Learn" button) or multi-touch gesture (see below).
 Once a config is preloaded, you can switch/switch-back between the preloaded and the current config with new actions like
 "SWS/S&M: Live Config n - Apply preloaded config (swap preload/current)"
 Preload comes in handy when switching FX chains, or Track Templates or with the new option "Offline all but active/preloaded tracks" (see below)
+<strong>Added Monitoring windows, demo http://stash.reaper.fm/14847/S%26M_LiveConfigMonitor.gif|here|</strong>
 - Useful with controllers that do not provide visual feedback
 - Support 2 fingers scroll gesture over "Current" and "Preload" areas, e.g. switch or preload instruments/effects with a trackpad
 - Click on the "Preload" area to swap the preloaded and the current config
 - Up to 4 Monitor Windows can be used simultaneously, i.e. one per Live Config/controller
+Added (per config) option: "Offline all but active/preloaded tracks (RAM savings)"
 When enabled, instruments/effects will be only be loaded for the current and preloaded tracks.
 Other tracks that are not part of the config will remain as they are, of course.
 This option works without preload too (switches will be slower though).
 Note: handle with care! Do not use <del>this option with</del> buggy instruments/effects!
+Added (per config) option: "Ignore switches to empty configs"
 When enabled, you will switch to the next/previous valid config whatever is the gap of empty configs in between.
 Especially useful for -/+ controllers (like pedals) and "Apply next/previous config" actions
+Added (per config) option: "Send all notes off when switching configs"
+Added (per config) option: "Select/scroll to track on list view click"
+Added (per config) option "Automatically update sends from the input track"
 When enabled, sends of the "Input track" will be automatically created/updated,
 each a new track is added/removed from the editor's list view, for example
+New logic for "Activation" and "Deactivation" actions/macros/scripts:
 - If a track is defined for a config (a row), only this track will be selected when the
   "Activation" (or "Deactivation") action is performed.
   Track selection is restored right after the action is performed.
   => Useful since many actions deal with "selected track(s)"
 - If no track is defined for a config, no track will be selected when the "Activation" (or "Deactivation")
   action is performed, track selection is restored right after
   => Useful to master the current selection state when performing actions
+Added "Tiny fades" knob
 It tweaks lengths of tiny fades-out/in when deactivating/activating configs.
 Disabling fades is allowed but instrument/effect switches might be glitchy!
 Note: when a config is made of trailing effects (delay, verb, etc..), you can either disable tiny fades,
 or better, route the (tiny faded) audio to a track which is not used by the Live Configs
+Added "Learn" button: direct action learn for "Apply" and "Preload" actions
+Added "Create input track" in the context menu (creates a track with needed properties and sends)
+Added "Switch delay" knob (no more S&M.ini file tweaks needed). One "Switch delay" per config.
+Added a bunch of actions (preload, toggle options or tiny fades on/off, open/close monitoring windows, etc..): filter the action list with "Live Config"!
 Note: some of the new actions are very specific and thus hidden by default (http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?p=984786#post984786|customizable in the S&M.ini file|)
+New context menu items in the Live Configs editor:
 - Copy/cut/paste configs (rows)
 - Insert config (shift rows up/down) + obey INSERT key
 - Apply/preload configs
 - Shortcuts: "Show FX chain..." and "Show routing window..." in Track column and Input track context menus

Region Playlist
+<strong>Playlist re-synchronization when seeking by hand or via actions</strong> (issue 532)
 Use-case example: now, you can also use actions like "Regions: Go to region #n" to switch regions defined in a playlist
 Note: when seeking to a position that is not part of the playlist, the extension will switch back ASAP to the region it was supposed to play
+Re-synchronize the playlist when editing it while playing (or when its regions are edited)
+Fixed various corner cases: audio block rounding, possible issues with unknown regions (e.g. deleted), etc..
+Improved monitoring mode (separate region numbers and region names, display number of remaining loops, new red "sync loss" status, etc..)
+Added options (in the context menu): "Seek play" and "Scroll view when selecting regions"
+Reorganized the window a bit: added columns, moved playlist length as tooltip, etc..

Cycle actions
+<strong>Added basic instructions: IF, IF NOT, and LOOP n</strong>
 This is mainly to ensure consistent toggle states for cycle actions but this also introduces conditional macros, see details and examples http://forum.cockos.com/showpost.php?p=1090262&postcount=1136|here|
 This is a "basic" support because you cannot yet have nested LOOPs or nested IFs. However you can have an IF in a LOOP or a LOOP in an IF.
+Toggle cycle actions now report real toggle states (i.e. the state of the first relevant action)
+Cycle action editor
 - Right list view: insert commands rather than adding them (avoids to systematically drag new commands)
 - Right list view: added "Add/insert instruction" in the context menu
 - Various tweaks, including new tiny buttons to enlarge list views

Export functions to ReaScript
+Fixed possible FNG function crash
+Added functions:
 - SNM_RemoveReceivesFrom()
 - SNM_SelectResourceBookmark()
 - http://forum.cockos.com/showpost.php?p=1099358&postcount=1162|SNM_TieResourceSlotActions()|
+Updated API, updated SNM_AddReceive() to obey preferences

Added actions
+Added "go to" marker/region actions
 REAPER already proposes 30 goto actions for markers and 40 for regions,
 so those new actions are just meant to target up to 99 regions/markers, they are <strong>hidden by default!</strong>
 This number of actions is http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?p=984786#post984786|customizable in the S&M.ini file|
 Note: comes in handy with the new Region Playlist "re-synchronization" feature, see above
 - SWS/S&M: Go to marker n (obeys smooth seek)
 - SWS/S&M: Go to region n (obeys smooth seek)
+Issue 528:
 - SWS/S&M: Insert marker at edit cursor
 - SWS/S&M: Insert marker at play cursor
+Issue 535:
 - SWS: Select unmuted items
 - SWS: Select unmuted items on selected tracks
+New on OS X (were already there on Windows OS):
 - SWS/S&M: Dump action list (w/o SWS extension)
 - SWS/S&M: Dump action list (SWS extension only)
 - SWS/S&M: Dump action list (custom actions only)

All list views:
+Obey to HOME, END, PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN keys
+OS X: obey to CMD-A like on Windows OS (select all)
+Windows OS: fixed a themed grid line glitch

Other:
+Fixed possible Auto color/icon crash when exiting REAPER
+Fixed possible crash with FX selection actions
+OS X: directory browsers allow directory creation (issue 511)
+OS X: fixed single line tooltips
+The action "SWS/S&M: Insert silence (measures.beats)" now supports tempo/time signature markers
+Offline FX actions now fully unload VST plugins
+Localization: sorted menus like default English menus
+Snapshot window: replaced the button "show/hide options" with 2 tiny buttons, i.e. fixes http://forum.cockos.com/showpost.php?p=1034735&postcount=969|this report|
+Resources window: moved the tick box "Tie slot actions to this bookmark" to the context menu ("advanced" stuff)
+Updated all S&M windows: removed margins when possible, every pixel counts!

!v2.3.0 #8 (November 1, 2012)
<strong>Region playlist: http://forum.cockos.com/showpost.php?p=1063758&postcount=10|new features for live use!|</strong>
+Support for infinite region loops, screenshot http://stash.reaper.fm/14468/S%26M_rgnplaylist_infiniteloop.jpg|here|
 Such regions will loop forever unless you switch to another region thanks to the new actions "Play previous/next region (smooth seek)".
+Added "Monitoring" mode, i.e. displays current/next regions with a "big font", screenshot http://stash.reaper.fm/14469/S%26M_rgnplaylist_monitoring.jpg|here|
 Click the new lock button to toggle monitoring/edition modes (or use the new related action).
 Note: the "big font" name can be customized in the S&M.ini file ("BigFontName" in the section [RegionPlaylist])
+Added actions:
 - SWS/S&M: Region Playlist - Play previous region (smooth seek)
 - SWS/S&M: Region Playlist - Play next region (smooth seek)
 - SWS/S&M: Region Playlist - Toggle monitoring/edition mode
+Seek play when switching regions/playlists

 Note: this last action (that adds points to selection) can make tinny changes to the envelope.
 It's a bug in Reaper, you can read about it http://forum.cockos.com/project.php?issueid=4416|here|

Other
+Cycle action editor: double-click in the "Id" column (or pressing the RETURN key) runs the selected cycle action
+Issue 488/Image window: display image filenames/slot numbers in tooltips
+Issue 525: the master track obeys the action "SWS: Minimize selected tracks"

+Select and adjust tempo markers improvements:
 - Option to invert selection only if marker obeys criteria. (possible usage: invert only within time selection)
 - Added button for deselecting markers that conform to criteria
 - Added button that toggles supplementary dialog which lets you deselect every Nth marker selected (possible usage: easier manipulation of linear points)

!v2.3.0 #6 (October 3, 2012)
<strong>Auto color for regions and markers, thanks Brado231!</strong> (issue 339)
+Added column "Type" (type = track, marker or region) in the "Auto color/icon" window's list
+Reorganized the window/context menus a bit
+Added options (new actions + new button "Options" + main menu > extensions > sws options)

 - Enable auto region coloring - Disabled by default!

<strong>Localization: (almost) everything can be translated!</strong>
Fixes/improvements (thanks Mr Data!):
+Fixed unused translations in various windows/dialog boxes
+Fixed stupid assumption that plural strings always end with 's'
+Auto-resize some buttons according to string lengths
Notes for translators:
+A new SWS Template LangPack file is available http://code.google.com/p/sws-extension/downloads/list|here|
+The following tools are intentionally not localized (to avoid useless translations):
 - S&M Find (a new version will come at some point)
 - SWS TrackList (might be removed at some point, over exceeded by the new native Track Manager)
 - A few (exotic) Xenakios tools

Export functions to ReaScript
+Added functions (more details in REAPER > Main menu > Help > HTML Lists > ReaScript documentation):
 - SNM_GetSetObjectState()
 - SNM_GetSetSourceState2()
 - SNM_GetSourceType()
 - SNM_RemoveReceive()

 - FNG_SetMidiNoteIntProperty()
 - FNG_AddMidiNote()
+Updated some APIs functions with WDL_FastString* parameters (tighter memory allocation + get rid of string length limitations for ReaScripters)
 Might be temporary, see details & example http://forum.cockos.com/showpost.php?p=1040948&postcount=1016|here|
+<strong>To request some functions please use/see issue 513</strong> (exported functions wish-list)

Added actions:
+SWS/BR: Move selected tempo markers forward
+SWS/BR: Move selected tempo markers back
+SWS/BR: Move selected tempo markers forward X ms
+SWS/BR: Move selected tempo markers back X ms
 Note: These actions don't screw with unselected points positions. Ideal for extensive tempo manipulation.
 First two actions move points depending on zoom, more zoom means less movement - recommended for keybinding.
 Others move points by predetermined values in milliseconds
+SWS/BR: Select and adjust tempo markers...
+SWS/BR: Move edit cursor to next/previous envelope point and select it
+SWS/S&M: Pan active takes of selected items to 25%, 50%, and 75% left and right
+SWS/S&M: [developer] Write C++ API functions header
 Internal stuff, for SWS devs only.

Updated actions "Set selected tracks folder states"
+Renamed actions:
 - "SWS/S&M: Set selected tracks folder states to on"  ->  "[...] to parent"
 - "SWS/S&M: Set selected tracks folder states to off"  ->  "[...] to normal"
+Added actions (they were missing for the above ones to make sense..):
 - SWS/S&M: Set selected tracks folder states to last of all folders
 - SWS/S&M: Set selected tracks folder states to last in folder
 Note: when this last action is performed on a track which is already the last one in a folder,
 running it again will turn the track into the last in the innermost and next-innermost folders, etc..

Region playlist
+Paste/crop to playlist: make sure envelopes are pasted too
 (whatever is the pref. "Envelope points move with media items")
+Avoid "flashy" cursor while playing playlists
+Reorganized the window/context menus a bit

Other
+Updated action "SWS/S&M: Remove all envelopes for selected tracks":
 This action removes all track/plugin envelopes. Now it also removes parameter modulations.
+Cycle action editor: added button "Import/export..."
+Issue 516/Resources: auto-save actions now overwrite empty selected slots
+Issue 515/Find window: RETURN key = find next (reminder: F3/Shift-F3 = find next/previous)
+GUI tweaks: smaller fonts on OS X, preserve XP style for list views on Windows OS, etc..

Fixes
+Issue 459: fixed possible crash when applying grooves
+Fixed some Xenakios actions related to takes
+Fixed inverted left/right channels for "SWS/S&M: Pan active takes of selected items to 100% left/right"
+Fixed faulty undo point for "Xenakios/SWS: Toggle selected takes normalized/unity gain"
+Minor fix in warning dialog for SWS/BR: Convert project markers to tempo markers

+Applying a track template file that contains several tracks now obeys multi-track selection - http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=104140|Example|: applying folder tracks to other projects
 Reminder: track template files can be applied in 2 different ways, either use items/envelopes present in template files or preserve existing items/envelopes, see details http://forum.cockos.com/showpost.php?p=979823&postcount=16|here|
 The following updates deal with the latter option:
 - Applying track templates now preserves all existing track envelopes (except FX parameter envelopes since FX Chains are replaced with templates' ones)
 - Applying track templates now preserves folder states

Region Playlist
+The playlist being played can be different from the displayed one

Region Playlist
+<strong>Play preview: no more constraint on region ends, the play preview now exactly follows region boundaries! REAPER v4.23+ is required</strong> (pre-release at the moment)
 Consequences: removed play preview options added in v2.2.0 #4 (useless now), added a warning message when there are nested regions/markers (due to the new smooth seek option)
+Do not force envelope points updates when pasting/cropping a playlist but obeys the preference "envelope points move with media items" instead (so both behaviors are now possible: copy/move envelope points or not)
+Fixed actions "Paste playlist" and "Append playlist" that were ignoring items smaller than region sizes
+Issue 461: fixed actions "Paste playlist" and "Append playlist" that were unexpectedly splitting items at region boundaries

!v2.2.0 #4 (April 9, 2012)
<strong>SWS localization</strong>
The SWS extension now also uses the language pack file defined in the preferences (just like REAPER).
The SWS template LangPack file is available http://code.google.com/p/sws-extension/downloads/list|here| (it will be regulary updated for "official" SWS releases).
This file should be merged with the main <strong>translated</strong> REAPER LangPack file as explained http://forum.cockos.com/showpost.php?p=941893&postcount=810|here|.
All action names can be translated (and most of undo point names: same string). Many dialog boxes and windows can be translated.

+Sanpshots
+Auto Color/Icon
+All S&M windows (+dynamically sized according to string lengths)

!v2.2.0 #3 (March 25, 2012)
<strong>Dropped support for REAPER v3.x, REAPER v4.20+ is required!</strong>

<strong>REAPER localization support</strong>: fixed broken Snapshots and LFO Generator vs localized envelope names, fixed action learn in S&M windows, Theme helper, etc..
Note: localization of the SWS extension is coming soon!

<strong>Added new "S&M Region Playlist" window</strong> - http://reaper.mj-s.com/S&M_RegionPlaylist.jpg|Screenshot|
Useful to preview different song structures (i.e. non-linear play) and apply them via the command "Crop project to playlist".
Use the context menu to add/remove/etc.. regions, use drag-drop to reorder regions in the playlist. Undo points are created for playlist editions.
Manage several playlists: top left dropdown box and tiny plus/minus buttons. Playlists are saved in project files.
Note: the play preview is based on "smooth seeking" so regions are played until the next measure (start positions of regions do not matter). Croping a project to a playlist will respect regions boundaries, of course.
Added related actions:
+SWS/S&M: Open/close Region Playlist window
+SWS/S&M: Play (Region Playlist)

Live Configs:
+OS X: FX presets support like on Windows OS

+Context menu: added "Learn current preset"

Cue buss generator:
+New dropdown box "Cue buss settings": up to 8 different settings can be defined

+Tweaks: removed confusing "save properties" button (settings are now saved on the fly), better OS X display, added error messages, etc..

Resources window and related "slot actions":
+<strong>All "SWS/S&M: Apply track template" actions now preserve receives.</strong> This is to use track templates a bit like snapsshots (track sends were already preserved).
 The same goes with "Apply track template" commands in the Resources window (on double-click or ENTER key).
+New option to sync auto-save and auto-fill directories: changing one changes the other
+Maximum number of bookmarks raised to 32
+Issue 450: retain the last used path when loading slots

Label processor:
+Added item duration (/D) and source offset (/O)

FX presets actions improvements: OS X support + improved on Windows OS (use new dedicated APIs)
Added in the main section of the action list (new on OS X):
+SWS/S&M: Trigger next preset for FX n of selected tracks - where 'n' is in [1; 4], http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?p=984786#post984786|customizable in the S&M.ini file| (up to 99 slots)
+SWS/S&M: Trigger previous preset for FX n of selected tracks - where 'n' is in [1; 4], http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?p=984786#post984786|customizable in the S&M.ini file| (up to 99 slots)

+SWS/S&M: Trigger previous preset for last touched FX

Marker list:
+Convert markers to regions
+Convert regions to markers

Other, fixes:
+All S&M windows: optional Windows-rendered fonts (ClearType)
 To enable this option set "ClearTypeFont" to 1 in the section [General] of the S&M.ini file (quit REAPER first!)
+Support the global preference "Disable saving full plugin states"
+Fixed all S&M copy/cut/paste sends/receives/routings actions (possible problem with multi track selection, see issue 174).
 Note: this also fixes SWS smart cut/copy actions: "SWS: Copy items/tracks/env, obeying time sel" and "SWS: Cut items/tracks/env, obeying time sel"
+Auto Color/Icon: fixed broken drag-drop of rows (i.e. useful to order rule priorities - reminder: drag-drop only works when the sorted column is the 1st one!)
+SWS List views tweaks: drag-drop of multiple rows, no arrow displayed when not sortable, etc..

 Note: your current numbers of slot actions are preserved, of course!

Notes/help: do not update region/marker names when playing and editing (but only when the view is locked)

<strong>S&M windows theming</strong>
S&M windows now use themed buttons (i.e. toolbar_blank.png and composite_toolbar_overlay.png, if it exists)
List views also obey following colors of the Theme Editor (REAPER > v4.11, on Windows OS and OS X!) :
+Window list selection bg
+Window list selection fg

!v2.0.0 #19 (April 29, 2011)
Added toolbar actions with "auto-refreshed" button states (if the new option "Main menu > Extensions > SWS Options > Enable toolbars auto refresh" is ticked):

+SWS/S&M: Toolbar left item selection toggle
+SWS/S&M: Toolbar top item selection toggle - Windows OS only!
+SWS/S&M: Toolbar bottom item selection toggle - Windows OS only!
 These actions are to prevent user errors with selected items that are offscreen.
 The idea is to put those actions into a toolbar: they will light up when some selected items are not visible in the arrange (offscreen).
 Clicking those buttons will deselect offscreen items (and re-selects them on toggle).
 See details, howto and toolbar auto-refresh anim http://forum.cockos.com/showpost.php?p=728774&postcount=315|here|.

+SWS/S&M: Toolbar track envelopes in touch/latch/write mode toggle

+SWS/S&M: Toggle toolbars auto refresh enable

 Remarks: these 2 last MIDI actions are present in the "S&M Extension" section (see top right dropdown in the action dialog box).
 They are a bit different from the native "Link to PG change" feature: they work with any type of FX (e.g. JS).
 Bonus: since v4, "Program Change" MIDI events can be learned.
+S&M Live Configs window: the "User preset" column is back !

Added other actions:
+SWS/S&M: Pan active takes of selected items to 100% right

+v4 only! (those actions are visible in v3 but are no-op)

S&M Resources window updates:
+Auto save button (top right) now *adds* new slots. Note: before, a new slot was inserted before the selected one but this could mess slot actions (because all following slot ids were changed..)
+Auto save button now proposes to define the auto save directory when needed
+Tweaks (better undo wordings, few user prefs were not saved, popup menu clean-up, etc.)
In "FX chain" mode (i.e. "FX chain" selected in the top left dropdown box):

 Remark: this action was limited to v3 empty takes before, i.e. takes with empty source
+The action "S&M Clear active take/items" now clears takes using v4 empty takes (rather than v3 empty takes). If all takes of an item are empty, the item is removed.

+Tagged action "Xenakios/SWS: Project media..." as deprecated

Issue 50:  SWS: Create regions from sel item(s) named with take
Issue 126: Warn about recording same inputs on multiple tracks: http://www.standingwaterstudios.com/shup/RecInputCheck.png Also added actions "SWS: Enable/Disable checking for duplicate inputs when recording."

!v2.0.0 #1 (January 19, 2011)
<strong>BETA: CAUTION !</strong>
Due to a change in the way S&M.ini file is managed, you may face some issues when switching between SWS official <-> SWS beta.
Well, a clean upgrade is automatically managed when SWS official -> SWS beta, but you'll probably loose your FX Chains setup when switching back to SWS beta -> SWS official.
So a backup of the "official" S&M.ini might be a good idea (or sticking with the beta as the new S&M.ini format won't change).

<strong>Short changelog:</strong>

+PiP support
+Many S&M updates (including new http://reaper.mj-s.com/resourceview.jpg|"Resources" window|: FX chains + Track templates + goodies). See details below.
+Updated SWS Autocolor view: now also features auto track icon. Demo http://reaper.mj-s.com/autoicon.gif|here|.
+Preliminary V4 updates (S&M, Padre, Xenakios)
+House cleaning, fixes

<strong>Changelog details:</strong>

Added S&M http://reaper.mj-s.com/resourceview.jpg|Resources window|
The "FX chains" view turned into a "Resources" window: FX chains + Track templates + goodies
The same features that exist for FX chains are now available for track templates too. A cool thing now is that we can patch existing tracks with track templates (and not only  "add track template as new track"). Well, some other sort of snapshots..
Also, saving track templates and FX chains is eased thanks to the "auto-save" feature, see below. A new feature "Auto-fill" also allows creating slots automatically.
Bonus: check out Tallisman's awesome FX Chain library, http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=35128|here|!
+Auto-save feature:
 An "Auto-save" button has been added: it automatically saves the selected tracks' FX chains (or track templates) and insert the related files/slots in the resource list.
 It's a one "click feature", i.e. no file browser is displayed: filenames are automatically generated from track names and saved in REAPER's default FX chains (or track templates) resource path.
 This "auto save" directory can be customized (new popup menu items "Set auto save directory") and filenames can now be renamed ("Name" column is editable).
+Auto-fill feature:
 If not already present, all FX chain (or track template) files found in the related resource path and its sub-folders are automatically inserted at the selected slot.
+Applying track templates preserves items:
 - if there's no item present in an applied track template file, the current ones are preserved
 - if some items are present in an applied track template file, those ones are used instead
 - if several tracks are present in a track template file, only the first one is used (when *applying*, when importing, all tracks present in the file are added)
+New actions:
 - SWS/S&M: Open Resources window (FX chains)... - just renamed (replaces "Open FX chains view...")
 - SWS/S&M: Open Resources window (track templates)...
 - SWS/S&M: Load/apply track template to selected tracks, slot n - where n is in [1;10]
 - SWS/S&M: Load/apply track template to selected tracks, prompt for slot
 - SWS/S&M: Load/import tracks from track template, slot n - where n is in [1;10]
 - SWS/S&M: Load/import tracks from track template, prompt for slot
 - SWS/S&M: Clear track template slot...
 Added actions that paste FX chains slots (exiting ones only "apply", i.e. replace FX Chains):
 - SWS/S&M: Load/paste FX chain to selected tracks, slot n - where n is in [1;8]
 - SWS/S&M: Load/paste FX chain to selected tracks, prompt for slot
 - SWS/S&M: Load/paste FX chain to selected items, slot n - where n is in [1;8]
 - SWS/S&M: Load/paste FX chain to selected items, prompt for slot
 - SWS/S&M: Load/paste FX chain to selected items, all takes, prompt for slot
+New popup menu items:
 - For FX chains and track templates: added "Auto fill (from resource path)"
 - Load/apply track template to selected tracks
 - Load/import tracks from track template
 - Set FX chain auto save directory...
 - Set track template auto save directory...
 - Auto save FX chains and insert slots (from track selection)
 - Auto save track templates and insert slots (from track selection)
 -> those 2 last menu items do the same things than the auto-save button, files are saved and inserted at the selected slot
 - Delete slots & files
 -> on Win, files are sent to the recycle bin
 - Show path in Explorer/Finder...
+Column "Name" is now editable (file renaming from the view)
+Drag-drop improvements:
 - Internal drag-drop of slots (i.e. now moves slots rather than copying them)
 - More 'natural' + fixed shortcomings: d'n'd of empty slots, selection after d'n'd, d'n'd when the list is empty, etc..
+On Win, "Display track template/FX chain" (in the popup menu) now launches notepad
+Paths pointing to unexisting files aren't emptyied anymore
+Tagged "Xenakios/SWS: Load track template n" actions as deprecated

Updated SWS Autocolor view: now also features auto track icon (the view has been renamed into "SWS Auto Color/Icon"), demo http://reaper.mj-s.com/autoicon.gif|here|.
+Added a column "Icon" in the view (right-click in this column or double-click it to set an icon filename) and a tick box "Enable auto icon".
+Also added action "SWS/S&M Toggle auto icon enable".
Rmk: your current color configurations will be preserved when upgrading..

S&M Notes/help view updates:
+Action help: now, when selecting custom macros, the related (veeeery long!) custom id is displayed in the text field (i.e. custom notes about macros are no more saved but that eases the copy/paste of custom ids)
+Action help: added http://reaper.mj-s.com/alrButton.jpg|"ALR" button|, i.e. online help to the http://wiki.cockos.com/wiki/index.php/Action_List_Reference|Action List Reference| wiki
+Added actions in order to make things clear:
 - SWS/S&M: Open Notes/Help window (project notes)...
 - SWS/S&M: Open Notes/Help window (item notes)...
 - SWS/S&M: Open Notes/Help window (track notes )...
 - SWS/S&M: Open Notes/Help window (action help)...
Remark: here's an http://reaper.mj-s.com/OnlineHelp.gif|anim| showing how to use notes, action help & online help

S&M Live Configs updates:
+Added "Auto track selection" option/tick box
+Fixed activate/deactivate actions not obeying the config's "Enable" parameter
+Added actions (in the main section) "SWS/S&M: Toggle enable live config n" - where n is in [1;8]
+Added advanced parameter "CC_DELAY" in S&M.ini (in REAPER's resource directory) - to be tweaked manually!
 If this parameter is set to 0, MIDI CC events will trigger their related "Apply live config" action *immediately* but, in this case, when moving a fader on a large scale for example, all configs in between will also be applied. With a delay (e.g. 250ms, the default value) only the last stable CC value will be taken into account.
+Undo points for all controls

S&M Cue buss:
+"Open Cue Buss window" is now a toggle action (+ reports a toggle state)
+When creating a cue buss, auto scroll to created the track (TCP)

S&M house cleaning:
+Cleaned the main "Extensions" menu a bit + added following menu items:
 - S&M Cue Buss...
 - S&M Find...
 - S&M Live Configs...
+Removed the following split actions:
 Contrary to their related native versions, the following ones were splitting selected items *and only them*, see http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=51547|this related thread|.
 Due to REAPER v3.67's new native pref "If no items are selected, some split/trim/delete actions affect all items at the edit cursor",
 those actions are less useful (well, they would still split only selected items even if that native pref is ticked).
 Also removed because of the spam in the action list (many split actions).
 - SWS/S&M: Split selected items at play cursor
 - SWS/S&M: Split selected items at time selection
 - SWS/S&M: Split selected items at edit cursor (no change selection)
 - SWS/S&M: Split selected items at time selection (select left)
 - SWS/S&M: Split selected items at time selection (select right)
 - SWS/S&M: Split selected items at edit or play cursor
 - SWS/S&M: Split selected items at edit or play cursor
+Removed the following take actions:
 Due to native actions "Rotate take lanes forward/backward" added in REAPER v3.67 (move active take up/down actions still there, of course).
 - SWS/S&M: Takes - Move all up (cycling) in selected items"
 - SWS/S&M: Takes - Move all down (cycling) in selected items"

Other S&M updates/fixes:
+Added action: SWS/S&M: Left mouse click at cursor position (use w/o modifier)
+Themable GUIs: hover, pressed,.. states for buttons, actions are now performed on mouse up events, un-stretched PNGs, default focus tweaks, tick boxes look better, use theme 3D colors for dropdows (if defined), etc..
+Fixed Notes/help and Resources views toggle states
+Fixed Adam's Fills Gaps actions
+Fixed disabled some popup items not being grayed
+Fixed UI refresh issues for "Find" and "Notes/help" views

Issue 225: Fixed selected text in Notes/help view when switching between docker tabs
