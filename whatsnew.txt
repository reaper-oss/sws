Fixed browsing for folder in Windows when path contains unicode characters
Fixed opening of groove presets with unicode characters in paths on Windows
Toolbar auto-refresh option disabled by default
House cleaning: removed "SWS/S&M: Let REAPER breathe" (see why http://forum.cockos.com/showpost.php?p=737539&postcount=378|here|.)
Cycle action updates:
+Now, MIDI Editor cycle actions can also run custom macro or ReaScripts
+Now, cycle actions can also run SWS actions
+More customizable cycle actions (and toolbar buttons):
-Optional dynamic action renaming (e.g. different tooltips for each step)
-Optional toggle state (butons can light up or not)

!v2.0.0 #20 (May 5, 2011)
Added cycle actions (user configurable):
+SWS/S&M: Create cycling action
+SWS/S&M: Create cycling ME action (event list)
+SWS/S&M: Create cycling ME action (piano roll)

Added actions:

!v2.0.0 #19 (April 29, 2011)
Added toolbar actions with "auto-refreshed" button states (if the new option "Main menu > Extensions > SWS Options > Enable toolbars auto refresh" is ticked):
+SWS/S&M: Toolbar right item selection toggle
+SWS/S&M: Toolbar left item selection toggle
+SWS/S&M: Toolbar top item selection toggle - WIN ONLY!
+SWS/S&M: Toolbar bottom item selection toggle - WIN ONLY!
These actions are to prevent user errors: related toolbar buttons will light up when some selected items are not visible in the arrange.
Clicking related buttons will also deselect items that are out of the current scope and re-selects them on toggle.
See details, howto and toolbar auto-refresh anim http://forum.cockos.com/showpost.php?p=728774&postcount=315|here|.
+AW's grid actions button states now reflect the current grid setting (when changed elsewhere in REAPER)
See grid toolbar auto-refresh anim http://stash.reaper.fm/8523/awGridToolbar.gif|here| and details about Adam's grid actions http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?p=706294|here|.
+SWS/S&M: Toolbar track envelopes in touch/latch/write mode toggle
This action sets track envelopes that are in one of the write modes into read mode and re-sets those previous write modes on toggle. Related toolbar buttons will light up if any envelope is in one of the write modes.
+SWS/S&M: Toggle toolbars auto refresh enable

Added FX preset actions (v4 only, see implementation remarks http://forum.cockos.com/showpost.php?p=728774&postcount=315|here|). They works with any type of FX and any presets (user or factory presets):
+SWS/S&M: Trigger next preset for selected FX of selected tracks
+SWS/S&M: Trigger previous preset for selected FX of selected tracks
+SWS/S&M: Trigger next preset for FX n of selected tracks - where 'n' is in [1; 4]
+SWS/S&M: Trigger previous preset for FX n of selected tracks - where 'n' is in [1; 4]
+SWS/S&M: Trigger preset for selected FX of selected tracks (MIDI CC absolute only)
+SWS/S&M: Trigger preset for FX n of selected tracks (MIDI CC absolute only) - where 'n' is in [1; 4]
Remarks: these 2 last MIDI actions are present in the "S&M Extension" section (see top right dropdown in the action dialog box). They are a bit different from the native "Link to PG change" feature: they work with any type of FX (e.g. JS). Bonus: since v4, "Program Change" MIDI events can be learned.
+S&M Live config view: the "User preset" column is back !

Added other actions:
+SWS/S&M: Pan active takes of selected items to 100% right
+SWS/S&M: Pan active takes of selected items to 100% left
+SWS/S&M: Pan active takes of selected items to center
Note: "pan takes" not "pan cakes".

+Many S&M track FX (and FX chain) actions run faster ("fix" for http://forum.cockos.com/showpost.php?p=724194&postcount=13)
+All S&M track envelope arming actions now support v4 panning (width/dual pan)
+Updated "SWS/S&M: Dump ALR Wiki summary [snip]" actions (FNG extension merge)

+SWS/S&M: Focus main window (close others)
+SWS/S&M: Focus next window (cycle, hide/unhide others)
+SWS/S&M: Focus previous window (cycle, hide/unhide others)
Remark: for these actions, keyboard shortcuts must use modifiers in order to pass-through to the main window (ex: Ctrl+minus = focus previous, Ctrl+plus = focus next)

House cleaning, removed "duplicated" actions (remaining focus actions now also focus the main window on cycle):
+SWS/S&M: Focus previous floating FX for selected tracks (+ main window on cycle)
+SWS/S&M: Focus next floating FX for selected tracks (+ main window on cycle)
+SWS/S&M: Focus previous floating FX (+ main window on cycle)
+SWS/S&M: Focus next floating FX (+ main window on cycle)

- SWS/S&M: Copy input FX chain from selected track
- SWS/S&M: Cut input FX chain from selected tracks
- SWS/S&M: Paste (replace) input FX chain to selected tracks
- SWS/S&M: Paste input FX chain to selected tracks
Remark:
- with S&M FX chain actions, you can copy a FX chain from a track, an item and paste it as an *input* FX chain and vice et versa (shared FX chain clipboard)
- v4 only (those actions are visible in v3 but are nop)

+S&M Resources view updates:
- Auto save button (top right) now *adds* new slots. Note: before, a new slot was inserted before the selected one but this could mess slot actions (because all following slot ids were changed..)
- Auto save button now proposes to define the auto save directory when needed
- Tweaks (better undo wordings, few user prefs were not saved, popup menu clean-up, etc.)
In "FX chain" mode (i.e. "FX chain" selected in the top left dropdown box):
- Added double click option to apply (or paste) FX chain slots as *input* FX chains (visible but nop in v3, see http://reaper.mj-s.com/S&M_ResourcesView_InputFx.jpg|screenshot|)
- Auto save FX chain (top right button) can now be configured to save track FX chains, *input* FX chains as well as active takes' FX chains, see http://reaper.mj-s.com/S&M_ResourcesView_popup.jpg|new popup menu|

S&M Find now supports v4 empty take lanes (fixes find in item notes, take names and take filenames)
Fixed issue 262: pre-FX and post-fader S&M cue buss actions now obey send & HW output default prefs (i.e. prefrences > project > track/send defaults). Note: pre-fader busses still mimic the volume of selected tracks.
Restored deprecated Xen's "Load track template n" (where n>10) actions

!v2.0.0 #12 (February 18, 2011)

Issue 245: Added "SWS: Goto/select next marker/region" and "SWS: Goto/select previous marker/region"
Autorender: Fixed bug where projects with relative paths to media files rendered silent tracks
Removed "SWS: Toggle auto fades for new items", use native "Toggle enable/disable default fadein/fadeout" instead

!v2.0.0 #10 (February 7, 2011)
Support for v4 empty take lanes:
+S&M build lanes actions now turn "take mosaics" into lanes using v4 empty takes (rather than v3 empty takes)
These actions still useful to create take lanes à la v4 from older project saved with "mosaics", for example.
+The action "S&M Remove empty take/item among selected items" now also removes v4 empty takes
Remark: this action was limited to v3 empty takes before, i.e. takes with empty source
+The action "S&M Clear active take/items" now clears takes using v4 empty takes (rather than v3 empty takes). If all takes of an item are empty, the item is removed.
Remark: a v4 empty take can be removed thanks to "S&M Cut active take" (removing a given empty take is not possible natively)

Main "Extensions" menu:
+Added AW's "Fill gaps..."
+Fixed "Envelope Processor..." menu item
+(Temporary?) removed "Item/Take" sub-menu (Xenakios actions need to be updated for v4)

Autorender:
+Added option to only render tracks with a specified prefix (and optionally remove that prefix from rendered files)
+Added global preferences menu
+Added option to not prepend track numbers to rendered files

Fixed corner case GUI refresh issue in S&M Resources view
Issue 250: Added action "SWS: Toggle auto fades for new items"

+"SWS: Toolbar arm toggle"
+"SWS: Set all sel tracks inputs to match first sel track"

Duplicate recording input check now ignores "input monitoring only" record mode.

+TCP context menu: removed Xenakios' "Track/Mixer/Envelopes" sub-menu (actions remain available in the action list and in the main "Extensions" menu)
+Tagged action "Xenakios/SWS: Project media..." as deprecated

Issue 50:  SWS: Create regions from sel item(s) named with take
Issue 126: Warn about recording same inputs on multiple tracks: http://www.standingwaterstudios.com/shup/RecInputCheck.png Also added actions "SWS: Enable/Disable checking for duplicate inputs when recording."

+Performance enhancements

!v2.0.0 #1 (January 19, 2011)
<b>BETA: CAUTION !</b>
Due to a change in the way S&M.ini file is managed, you may face some issues when switching between SWS official <-> SWS beta.
Well, a clean upgrade is automatically managed when SWS official -> SWS beta, but you'll probably loose your FX Chains setup when switching back to SWS beta -> SWS official.
So a backup of the "official" S&M.ini might be a good idea (or sticking with the beta as the new S&M.ini format won't change).

<b>Short changelog:</b>

+PiP support
+Many S&M updates (including new http://reaper.mj-s.com/resourceview.jpg|"Resources" view|: FX chains + Track templates + goodies). See details below.
+Updated SWS Autocolor view: now also features auto track icon. Demo http://reaper.mj-s.com/autoicon.gif|here|.
+Preliminary V4 updates (S&M, Padre, Xenakios)
+House cleaning, fixes

<b>Changelog details:</b>

Added S&M http://reaper.mj-s.com/resourceview.jpg|Resources view|
+The "FX chains" view turned into a "Resources" view: FX chains + Track templates + goodies
Abstract:
The same features that exist for FX chains are now available for track templates too. A cool thing now is that we can patch existing tracks with track templates (and not only  "add track template as new track"). Well, some other sort of snapshots..
Also, saving track templates and FX chains is eased thanks to the "auto-save" feature, see below. A new feature "Auto-fill" also allows creating slots automatically.
Bonus: check out Tallisman's awesome FX Chain library, http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=35128|here|!
+Auto-save feature:
An "Auto-save" button has been added: it automatically saves the selected tracks' FX chains (or track templates) and insert the related files/slots in the resource list.
It's a one "click feature", i.e. no file browser is displayed: filenames are automatically generated from track names and saved in REAPER's default FX chains (or track templates) resource path.
This "auto save" directory can be customized (new popup menu items "Set auto save directory") and filenames can now be renamed ("Name" column is editable).
+Auto-fill feature:
If not already present, all FX chain (or track template) files found in the related resource path and its sub-folders are automatically inserted at the selected slot.
+Applying track templates preserves items:
- if there's no item present in an applied track template file, the current ones are preserved
- if some items are present in an applied track template file, those ones are used instead
- if several tracks are present in a track template file, only the first one is used (when *applying*, when importing, all tracks present in the file are indeed added)
+New actions:
SWS/S&M: Open Resources window (FX chains)... - just renamed (replaces "Open FX chains view...")
SWS/S&M: Open Resources window (track templates)...
SWS/S&M: Load/apply track template to selected tracks, slot n - where n is in [1;10]
SWS/S&M: Load/apply track template to selected tracks, prompt for slot
SWS/S&M: Load/import tracks from track template, slot n - where n is in [1;10]
SWS/S&M: Load/import tracks from track template, prompt for slot
SWS/S&M: Clear track template slot...
Added actions that paste FX chains slots (exiting ones only "apply", i.e. replace FX Chains):
SWS/S&M: Load/paste FX chain to selected tracks, slot n - where n is in [1;8]
SWS/S&M: Load/paste FX chain to selected tracks, prompt for slot
SWS/S&M: Load/paste FX chain to selected items, slot n - where n is in [1;8]
SWS/S&M: Load/paste FX chain to selected items, prompt for slot
SWS/S&M: Load/paste FX chain to selected items, all takes, prompt for slot
+New popup menu items:
- For FX chains and track templates: added "Auto fill (from resource path)"
- Load/apply track template to selected tracks
- Load/import tracks from track template
- Set FX chain auto save directory...
- Set track template auto save directory...
- Auto save FX chains and insert slots (from track selection)
- Auto save track templates and insert slots (from track selection)
-> those 2 last menu items do the same things than the auto-save button, files are saved and inserted at the selected slot
- Delete slots & files
-> on Win, files are sent to the recycle bin
- Show path in Explorer/Finder...
+Column "Name" is now editable (file renaming from the view)
+Drag'n'drop improvments:
- Internal drag'n'drop of slots (i.e. now moves slots rather than copying them)
- More 'natural' + fixed shortcomings: d'n'd of empty slots, selection after d'n'd, d'n'd when the list is empty, etc..
+On Win, "Display track template/FX chain" (in the popup menu) now launches notepad
+Paths pointing to unexisting files aren't reseted anymore
+Tagged "Xenakios/SWS: Load track template n" actions as deprecated

Updated SWS Autocolor view: now also features auto track icon (the view has been renamed into "SWS Auto Color/Icon").
Demo http://reaper.mj-s.com/autoicon.gif|here|.
Rmk: current color configurations will be preserved when upgrading..
+Added a column "Icon" in the view (right-click in this column or double-click it to set an icon filename) and a tick box "Enable auto icon".
+Also added action "SWS/S&M Toggle auto icon enable".

S&M Notes/help view updates:
+Action help: now, when selecting custom macros, the related (veeeery long!) custom id is displayed in the text field (i.e. custom notes about macros are no more saved but that eases the copy/paste of custom ids)
+Action help: added http://reaper.mj-s.com/alrButton.jpg|"ALR" button|. Just to make clear the online help (i.e. to the http://wiki.cockos.com/wiki/index.php/Action_List_Reference|Action List Reference wiki) feature
+Added actions in order to make things clear:
- SWS/S&M: Open Notes/Help window (project notes)...
- SWS/S&M: Open Notes/Help window (item notes)...
- SWS/S&M: Open Notes/Help window (track notes )...
- SWS/S&M: Open Notes/Help window (action help)...
Remark: here's an http://reaper.mj-s.com/OnlineHelp.gif|anim| showing how to use notes, action help & online help

S&M Live Configs updates:
+Added "Auto track selection" option/tick box
+Fixed activate/deactivate actions not obeying the config's "Enable" parameter
+Added actions (in the main section) "SWS/S&M: Toggle enable live config n" - where n is in [1;8]
+Added advanced parameter "CC_DELAY" in S&M.ini (in REAPER's resource directory) - to be tweaked manually!
If this parameter is set to 0, MIDI CC events will trigger their related "Apply live config" action *immediately* but, in this case, when moving a fader on a large scale for example, all configs in between will also be applied. With a delay (e.g. 250ms, the default value) only the last stable CC value will be taken into account.
+Undo points for all controls

S&M Cue buss:
+"Open Cue Buss window" is now a toggle action (+ reports a toggle state)
+When creating a cue buss, auto scroll to created the track (TCP)

S&M house cleaning:
+Cleaned the main "Extensions" menu a bit + added following menu items:
S&M Cue Buss...
S&M Find...
S&M Live Configs...
+Removed the folowing split actions:
Contrary to their related native versions, the following ones were spliting selected items *and only them*, see http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=51547|this related thread|.
Due to REAPER v3.67's new native pref "If no items are selected, some split/trim/delete actions affect all items at the edit cursor", those actions are less useful (well, they would still split only selected items even if that native pref is ticked). Also removed because of the spam in the action list (many split actions).

Fixed bug with FX chain view/actions: double click, apply actions, etc.

!v1.8.2 #10 (October 29, 2010)
Fixed last step of undo zoom sometimes going "nowhere".
"SWS/AdamWathan: Fade in/out/crossfade selected area of selected items" now fades in/out to edit cursor if the edit cursor is inside the item and there is no time selection touching the item. It also "crops" the fade in/out to the time selection of a selected item if the selection is completely contained within the item.
"SWS/AdamWathan: Record Conditional (normal record mode unless time sel exists, then autopunch)" now doesn't change modes if the current mode is "Auto Punch Selected Items".
Added "SWS/AdamWathan: Record (automatically group simultaneously recorded items)" which will automatically group simultaneously recorded items if you are toggling in and out of record during playback. Also added the "conditional" version of the same thing for anyone using the conditional action in place of the native action.

!v1.8.2 #6 (October 23, 2010)
Added middle mouse button modifiers to the zoom preferences dialog.

!v1.8.2 #5 (October 22, 2010)
There's a few new zoom tool features!  http://www.standingwaterstudios.com/shup/zoomTool4.gif|Here's a demo|.
To access the new features, use the SWS Zoom preferences dialog.  You can find it in the Extensions menu.
The available options are:
+Zoom with middle mouse button
<i>Use the middle mouse button to drag-zoom.  Note this overrides Reaper's middle mouse button behavior, e.g. scrub.</i>
+No-drag click zooms to item under cursor
<i>Clicking without dragging in zoom mode on an item zooms to that item</i>
+No-drag click to undo zoom
<i>Clicking goes to the previous zoom level/position.  If you have item zoom mode on (above option), then undo zoom works when you're clicking on empty space.</i>
+Unzoom mode when dragging up (Windows only)
<i>When in zoom mode, drag the box in the up direction to get a little representation of the current view, and the box around it will be the "new view".  Try it!</i>

I consider this an interim release, the above options will be added to and refined soon.
Also fixed zoom bugs when the master track is visible in the TCP.

Adam's updates:
+Added action SWS/AdamWathan: Record (conditional, normal record mode unless time sel exists, then autopunch)
+Updated AdamWathan Fill Gaps function, now gives option to automatically add markers marking potential artifacts after filling gaps

!v1.8.0 #1 (September 20, 2010)
<b>REQUIRES REAPER v3.66 - These are the released changes from Beta #6! - Mostly S&M updates:</b>

Added new dockable view "S&M Live Configs" and 8 actions "Apply live config n (MIDI CC only)" where n is [1,8].
This is for live performance: optimize CPU/RAM use, get rid of the 16 MIDI channel limit, etc.
Typical workflow example: route your armed input track to the tracks you have configured in the "Live Configs" view.  Then, while playing, you send CC messages (previoulsy learnt) to automatically switch between those tracks/configurations you have defined: mute all tracks except the active one, mute all receives from the input track except for the active one, load track templates, load FX Chains and/or run custom actions when activating/deactivating a config.
These actions belong to a new section "S&M Extension". See details http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=63775|here|.  Demo http://reaper.mj-s.com/LiveConfig.gif|here|.
Added action "SWS/S&M: Open Live Configs window..." (in the main section)

Build lane actions updated:
+Now, the lanes order always match the recording order and work with all media types (including MIDI in-project ones).
+Demo http://reaper.mj-s.com/buildlanes.gif|here|.
+Limitation: for the moment, "building lanes" on *imploded* isn't supported, details http://forum.cockos.com/showpost.php?p=577538&postcount=68|here|.
+Added action "SWS/S&M: Takes - Activate lane under mouse cursor"

S&M FX Chain view improvments:
+Paste of FX Chains in now possible (only FX Chain replacement was possible until now)
+External drag'n'drop of FX Chains (e.g. drag from an external explorer, drop into the view)
+Internal drag'n'drop of FX Chains (drag from the view, drop in a track) - WIN ONLY
+Added actions:
SWS/S&M: Paste FX chain to selected items
SWS/S&M: Paste FX chain to selected items, all takes
SWS/S&M: Paste FX chain to selected tracks
+Renamed actions, added "(replace)" to make things clear:
SWS/S&M: Paste (replace) FX chain to selected items
SWS/S&M: Paste (replace) FX chain to selected items, all takes
SWS/S&M: Paste (replace) FX chain to selected tracks
+Added popup items "Add slot", "Insert slot" and "Delete slots"
+Text filter added, demo http://stash.reaper.fm/6083/FXChainFiltering.gif|here|
+Simplified display in the "Path" column (when using REAPER's FX Chains default path)
+Added a column "Description", double-click to enter some text. Note: it's volountary not used when filtering.
+Safer cut/copy/paste actions

Added new dockable view "S&M Notes/help" for item notes, track notes and, on Win, custom/online action help:
+Online help (link to the http://www.cockos.com/wiki/index.php/Action_List_Reference|Action List Reference|): click on the action name.
+When enabled, the lock button just allows key stroke to pass through the main window.
+S&M Notes/help & S&M Find demo: http://reaper.mj-s.com/notes_and_find.gif|here|.
+Added related actions:
SWS/S&M: Open Notes/help window...
SWS/S&M: Notes/help - Switch to action help - WIN ONLY
SWS/S&M: Notes/help - Switch to item notes
SWS/S&M: Notes/help - Switch to track notes
SWS/S&M: Notes/help - Switch to project notes (disable auto updates)  (<i>Note this is *not* REAPER's project notes.</i>)
SWS/S&M: Notes/help - Set action help file...
<i>This action sets the filename where your custom notes about actions will be saved (so that you can have different ones, e.g. multi-language). By default this file is set for you, it's S&M_Action_help_en.ini (in REAPER's default resource directory, with other ini files). It's where *action* notes are saved, other notes (item, track and project) are saved in RPP files.</i>
SWS/S&M: Notes/help - Toggle lock

Added new dockable view "S&M Find" (bound to Ctrl-F) with find all, previous & next buttons.
Simple: when something matches, it's selected.
The available search scopes are: item names, item names (all takes), media filenames, media filenames (all takes), item notes, track notes, track names (in case you're drunk) and marker/region names.

Track folders actions:
+SWS/S&M: Save selected tracks folder states
+SWS/S&M: Restore selected tracks folder states
+SWS/S&M: Set selected tracks folder states to on
+SWS/S&M: Set selected tracks folder states to off <i>note: the 2 previous ones are different from native action "Cycle track folder state"</i>
+SWS/S&M: Save selected tracks folder compact states
+SWS/S&M: Restore selected tracks folder compact states

+SWS/S&M: Disarm all active envelopes for selected tracks

+SWS/S&M: Toggle arming of pan envelope for selected tracks
+SWS/S&M: Toggle arming of mute envelope for selected tracks
+SWS/S&M: Toggle arming of all receive volume envelopes for selected tracks
+SWS/S&M: Toggle arming of all receive pan envelopes for selected tracks
+SWS/S&M: Toggle arming of all receive mute envelopes for selected tracks
+SWS/S&M: Toggle arming of all plugin envelopes for selected tracks
+Remarks:
These actions only apply for ACTIVE envelopes (i.e. these actions don't create envelopes)
Send envelopes are not (yet) managed, use receive envelopes instead
As these toggle actions act on several tracks, the reported toggle state is a "best effort" one

Action List Reference summaries auto generation (Wiki copy/pastable) - Win only
+See details http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=61929|here|. ALR: http://www.cockos.com/wiki/index.php/Action_List_Reference|here|.
+SWS/S&M: Save ALR Wiki summary (w/o extensions)
+SWS/S&M: Save ALR Wiki summary (SWS/Xenakios/S&M extensions only)

Implemented FRs: Issue 166, Issue 170, part of Issue 19, most part of Issue 105

Fixes:
+ Issue 163: SWS snapshots crash
+ Issue 164: fixed possible crash in reaConsole
+ Issue 169: deprecated Xen's actions "Delete selected item and source media (immediately!)" and similar ones
+ Issue 172: fixed slow S&M actions with certain plugins and/or massive in-project items
+ Issue 174: S&M paste routing/sends/receives actions only paste to the 1st selected track
+ Issue 182: fixed strange S&M.ini location on OSX

Added actions:
+"Select project (MIDI CC only)" <i>Remarks: this action belong to the "S&M section". Learn: absolute CC only. Only the last "stable" CC is processed (i.e. doesn't stuck REAPER).</i>
+SWS/S&M: Delete selected items' takes and source files (prompt, no undo)
+SWS/S&M: Delete selected items' takes and source files (no undo)
+SWS/S&M: Delete active take and source file in selected items (prompt, no undo)
+SWS/S&M: Delete active take and source file in selected items (no undo) (<i>On Win, source files are moved to the recycle bin.</i>)
+Preview selected media item at track fader volume (toggle)

Misc updates:
+Better management of the "S&M" ini file: it's now located in REAPER's default resource path (i.e. with other ini files) rather than "<REAPER_install_dir>/Plugins/"
+Slight action renaming (mispelling, better display order)
+Auto-icon from betas is turned off due to too many issues.
+Fixed action "Randomize item positions"

!v1.7.3 #4 (August 29, 2010)

Issue 164: Fixed Reaconsole wildcard handling

!v1.7.3 #1 (July 15, 2010)
<b>Requires REAPER v3.651!</b>

S&M updates:
+Added actions:
- SWS/S&M: Active ME - Hide all CC lanes
- SWS/S&M: Active ME - Create CC lane
- SWS/S&M: Active ME - Save displayed CC lanes, slot <i>n</i> (n: 1..4)
- SWS/S&M: Active ME - Set displayed CC lanes, slot <i>n</i> (n: 1..4)
Note: those actions apply to the active MIDI Editor but only belong to the main section of the action list, for the moment. Displayed CC lanes are saved in <my_reaper_dir>/Plugins/S&M.ini
- SWS/S&M: Cycle focused window (win only)
This actions need to be bind with a special modifier in order to pass-thru the main window (example: Ctrl Shift a).
Also, few windows eat keystrokes, it will not work for them (e.g. action list which text filter is focused by default).
- SWS/S&M: Let REAPER breathe
This action only makes sense for corner cases macros (see MIDI Editor example http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=60657|here|)
+Fixes:
- issue 140, part of issue 161
- FX Chain view: fixed "Clear slot" actions

!v1.7.2 #10 (June 14, 2010)
S&M updates:
+All S&M toggle actions now report their toggle states to toolbar buttons and menus
Notes: with a mix of different toggle states (e.g. toggle something for several tracks), the state will be a "best effort" one. Also, native "limitation": button states aren't always refreshed (contray to their tooltips..)
+Updated following actions so that floating FX are hidden when the main window gets the focus
SWS/S&M: Focus previous floating FX for selected tracks (& main window on cycle)
SWS/S&M: Focus next floating FX for selected tracks (& main window on cycle)
SWS/S&M: Focus previous floating FX (& main window on cycle)
SWS/S&M: Focus next floating FX (& main window on cycle)
+Added actions: alternative to native actions, they split -only- and all selected items, see details http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=51547|here| :
SWS/S&M: Split selected items at play cursor
SWS/S&M: Split selected items at time selection
SWS/S&M: Split selected items at edit cursor (no change selection)
SWS/S&M: Split selected items at time selection (select left)

SWS/S&M: Split selected items at edit or play cursor
SWS/S&M: Split selected items at edit or play cursor (ignoring grouping)
SWS/gofer: Split selected items at mouse cursor (obey snapping)
Note: this one is from gofer (REAPER forum member), it was just traduced from Python. Usefull with an armed toolbar button.
+Fixes:
All cycle FX focus/float-only actions (corner case issues with the master track)
Some float, unfloat FX actions with multiple track selection

where n is in [1; 8]. Multi-selection not possible (yet?)

Added FX chain actions:
+Copy FX chain from selected track
+Cut FX chain from selected track
+Paste FX chain to selected track(s)
rmk: the FX chain "clipboard" is shared with items, so it's possible to copy/paste from tracks to items and vice-et-versa

+Load/Paste FX chain to selected item(s), prompt for slot
+Load/Paste FX chain to selected item(s), all takes, prompt for slot
+List FX chain slots...

I added those 2 last actions just as a facility (better than opening <my_reaper_dir>/Plugins/S&M.ini a text editor)

+Comping - Clear active take(s)
this one was added in the previous build, just slightly renamed
+Comping - Build lane(s) for selected track(s)
